# Why is Scripting So Powerful in ProcessMaker?

Scripts allow ProcessMaker Process Owners and Developers to write a script that can be used throughout any of your business processes. In other words, "write once, use anywhere." After scripts are written, they can be deployed in any business process you design for your organization.

Scripts are run within isolated containers for greater security. Furthermore, scripts can be tested within the same authoring environment to ensure they function as intended. 

ProcessMaker 4 supports Lua and PHP scripts out-of-the-box.
