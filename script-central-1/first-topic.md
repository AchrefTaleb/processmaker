# Why is Scripting So Powerful in ProcessMaker?

Scripts allow Process Owners and ProcessMaker Developers to write a self-contained programmatic action that can be called from any business process during run-time. The same script can be deployed in any business process you design for your organization. In other words, "write once, use anywhere."

While writing a script, test it before you deploy it. Scripts are tested within the same authoring environment to ensure they function as intended.

During run-time, scripts run within isolated containers for greater security. After the script runs and returns output to the process, the container that ran the script automatically deletes itself.

ProcessMaker 4 supports Lua and PHP scripts out-of-the-box.
