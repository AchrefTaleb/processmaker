# Write and Test Scripts

Scripts allow ProcessMaker Process Owners and Developers to write scripts to be used throughout any of your business processes. Scripts are run within isolated containers for greater security. Furthermore, scripts can be tested within the same authoring environment to ensure they function as intended.

ProcessMaker 4 supports Lua and PHP scripts out-of-the-box.
