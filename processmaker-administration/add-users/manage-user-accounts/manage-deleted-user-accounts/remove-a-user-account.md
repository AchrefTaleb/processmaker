# Delete a User Account

## Overview

A [ProcessMaker user](../../what-is-a-user.md) account may be deleted regardless of its status. When a ProcessMaker user account is deleted, the person assigned to that account can no longer log in to ProcessMaker.

Deleting a ProcessMaker account is not permanent. After a ProcessMaker user account is deleted, that user account displays in the [**Deleted Users** tab](view-or-edit-deleted-user-accounts.md).
