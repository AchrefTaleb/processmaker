# View Deleted User Accounts

## Overview

After a [ProcessMaker user](../../what-is-a-user.md) account is [deleted](remove-a-user-account.md#delete-a-processmaker-user-account), that user account displays in the **Deleted Users** tab where that user account may be restored. A restored ProcessMaker user account has the same status as when it was deleted. When a ProcessMaker user account is restored, the person assigned to that user account may log on to ProcessMaker if that user account is of Active status.
