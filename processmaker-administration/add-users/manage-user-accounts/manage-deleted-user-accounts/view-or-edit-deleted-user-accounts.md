# View Deleted User Accounts

## Overview

After a [ProcessMaker user](../../what-is-a-user.md) account is [deleted](remove-a-user-account.md#delete-a-processmaker-user-account), that user account displays in the **Deleted Users** tab where that user account may be restored. A restored ProcessMaker user account has the same status as when it was deleted. When a ProcessMaker user account is restored, the person assigned to that user account may log on to ProcessMaker if that user account is of Active status.

## View All Deleted ProcessMaker User Accounts <a id="view-all-scripts"></a>

ProcessMaker displays all ProcessMaker user accounts in one table that ProcessMaker Administrators throughout your organization have deleted. This makes it easy to manage deleted ProcessMaker user accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Users: View Users" permission to view the list of deleted users unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the [Users](../../../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#users) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
