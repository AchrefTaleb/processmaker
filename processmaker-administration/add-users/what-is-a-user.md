# What is a User?

## Overview

In ProcessMaker, a user is any person associated with a ProcessMaker account that allows that individual to do the following:

* Log on to ProcessMaker using unique credentials
* Adjust his or her [user profile](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md)
* Start, cancel, and/or participate in [Requests](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md)
* Do [Tasks](../../using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task.md)

Note that any person who interacts with a Request is not necessarily a ProcessMaker user. For example, an anonymous person can participate in a Request via a [Web Entry](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/web-entry.md) URL, but is not a ProcessMaker user because an anonymous person does not have a ProcessMaker account.
