# What is Single Sign-On?

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

To single sign-on to ProcessMaker, the [SAML package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saml-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The SAML package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the SAML package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Security Assertion Markup Language \(SAML\) package to allow ProcessMaker users to log on and off from your ProcessMaker instance using a single account within your organization. This is referred to as single sign-on \(SSO\). For example, if your organization uses Google to authenticate people in your organization, ProcessMaker users in your organization authenticate into your ProcessMaker instance using their Google credentials.

The SAML package uses the [SAML 2.0 open standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0).

The ProcessMaker SAML package requires an HTTPS connection and access to a SAML identity provider service.
