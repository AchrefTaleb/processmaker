### ProcessMaker Package Required

To reset all ProcessMaker user interface labels and messages to their defaults, the [Translations package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/non-english-language-packages.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Translations package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Translations package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to reset all ProcessMaker user interface labels and messages to their defaults unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

See the ProcessMaker [Translations](../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#translations) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
