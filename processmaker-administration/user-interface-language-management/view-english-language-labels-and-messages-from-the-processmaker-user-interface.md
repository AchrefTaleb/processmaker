### ProcessMaker Package Required

To view the English-language labels and messages from the ProcessMaker user interface, the [Translations package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/non-english-language-packages.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Translations package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Translations package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Translations: View Translations" permission to view the translations of the ProcessMaker user interface unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected.

See the [Translations](../permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#translations) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
