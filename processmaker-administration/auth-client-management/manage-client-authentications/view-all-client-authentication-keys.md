# View All Client Authentication Keys

## View All Client Authentication Keys <a id="view-all-scripts"></a>

ProcessMaker displays all client authentication keys to access the [ProcessMaker 4 REST API](https://develop-demo.bpm4.qa.processmaker.net/api/documentation) in one table that ProcessMaker Administrators throughout your organization have created. This makes it easy to manage client authentication keys.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the "Auth Client: View Auth Client" permission to view the list of authentication keys.

Ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance if necessary.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all client authentication keys granted access to the ProcessMaker REST API:

1. [Log in](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Admin** option from the top menu. The **Users** page displays.
3. Click the **Auth Clients** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/auth-client-icon-admin.png). The **Auth Clients** page displays all client authentication keys.
