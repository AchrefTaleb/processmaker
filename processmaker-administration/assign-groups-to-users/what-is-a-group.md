# What is a Group?

In ProcessMaker 4, a group is a set of permissions that collectively allow ProcessMaker users to view information or perform actions in ProcessMaker. A ProcessMaker group may then be [assigned to a ProcessMaker user](../add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md). ProcessMaker groups makes it easy for ProcessMaker Administrators to manage ProcessMaker permissions across their organization.

ProcessMaker recommends creating the following ProcessMaker groups based on how each type of ProcessMaker user interacts with ProcessMaker:

* ProcessMaker user
* Process Owner
* ProcessMaker Developer
* ProcessMaker Administrator

[This document is organized](../../start-here/how-to-use-this-document.md) for these types of groups.
