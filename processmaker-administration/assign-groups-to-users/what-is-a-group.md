# What is a Group?

In ProcessMaker 4, a group is a set of permissions that collectively allow ProcessMaker users to view information or perform actions in ProcessMaker. A ProcessMaker group may then be [assigned to a ProcessMaker user](../add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md). ProcessMaker groups makes it easy for ProcessMaker Administrators to manage ProcessMaker permissions across their organization.

ProcessMaker recommends creating the following ProcessMaker groups based on how each type of ProcessMaker user interacts with ProcessMaker:

* **ProcessMaker user:** Most ProcessMaker users start or participate in Requests and perform Tasks. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests.
* **Process Owner:** Process Owners create Process models. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests, Processes, Process Categories Screens, and Environment Variables.
* **ProcessMaker Developer:** ProcessMaker Developers create ProcessMaker Scripts. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests, Scripts, and API related permissions.
* **ProcessMaker Administrator:** ProcessMaker Administrators administer the ProcessMaker environment and its users. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests, Users, Groups, and Comment permissions.

The ProcessMaker 4 product documentation is [organized](../../start-here/how-to-use-this-document.md) for these types of groups.
