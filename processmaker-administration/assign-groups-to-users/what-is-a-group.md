# What is a Group?

In ProcessMaker 4, a group is a set of permissions assigned to ProcessMaker user members to view information or perform actions in ProcessMaker. You may then [specify which ProcessMaker users are members of a group](manage-groups/edit-a-group.md#edit-a-processmaker-group). ProcessMaker groups make it easy to manage permissions for multiple ProcessMaker user accounts with identical permission assignments.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may also [specify from a ProcessMaker user account which group\(s\) that user is a member](../add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md#edit-a-processmaker-user-account).
{% endhint %}

ProcessMaker recommends creating the following ProcessMaker groups based on how each type of ProcessMaker user interacts with ProcessMaker:

* **ProcessMaker user:** Most ProcessMaker users start or participate in Requests and perform Tasks. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests.
* **Process Owner:** Process Owners create Process models. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests, Processes, Process Categories Screens, and Environment Variables.
* **ProcessMaker Developer:** ProcessMaker Developers create ProcessMaker Scripts. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests, Scripts, and API related permissions.
* **ProcessMaker Administrator:** ProcessMaker Administrators administer the ProcessMaker environment and its users. Their permission assignments may be limited to Requests, Users, Groups, and Comment permissions.

The ProcessMaker 4 product documentation is [organized](../../start-here/how-to-use-this-document.md) for these types of groups.
