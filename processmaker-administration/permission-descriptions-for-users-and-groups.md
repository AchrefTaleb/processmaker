# Permission Descriptions for Users and Groups

## Overview

In ProcessMaker 4, a permission allows a ProcessMaker user member to view a type of information or perform an action in ProcessMaker. Below are some examples of ProcessMaker permissions:

* Start Requests
* View the list of Processes
* Edit Processes
* Edit ProcessMaker Screens
* Create Environment Variables
* View Task Assignments through the [ProcessMaker 4 API](https://develop.bpm4.qa.processmaker.net/api/documentation)

### Assign Permissions to Users and Groups

While permissions apply to ProcessMaker users, those permissions can be assigned from a user account or a ProcessMaker group:

* **User-level permissions:** Permissions can be assigned to a ProcessMaker user account. These permission assignments only apply to that user account.
* **Group-level permissions:** Permissions can be assigned to a ProcessMaker group. A group assigns permissions to all ProcessMaker user account members. ProcessMaker groups make it easy to manage permissions for multiple ProcessMaker user accounts with identical permission assignments.

### User and Group Permissions are Cumulative

User-level and group-level permission assignments are cumulative. This means that a ProcessMaker user account has all the group-level permission assignments from all groups memberships, but also has the flexibility of permission assignments that apply only to that ProcessMaker user account. For example, a ProcessMaker user account might be a member of a group whereby its members can view the list of all Processes. However, a ProcessMaker Administrator can assign the permission to edit Processes to only the one ProcessMaker user account.

## Permission Descriptions

Permissions are organized into categories. Permission are described below by category and how each permission affects ProcessMaker functionality. These permissions function identically in ProcessMaker user accounts and groups.
