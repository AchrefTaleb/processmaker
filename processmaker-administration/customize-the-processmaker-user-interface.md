Your user account must have the **Make this user a Super Admin** option selected to customize the ProcessMaker user interface.

See [Edit a User Account](add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md#edit-a-processmaker-user-account) or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

3. Click the **Customize UI** icon![](../.gitbook/assets/customize-ui-icon-admin.png). The **Customize UI** page displays.

The logo and icon in the ProcessMaker user interface work together: the logo represents the complete name, tagline and any other trademarked assets for the brand; the icon represents the stand-alone icon for the brand.

   Follow these guidelines to change the default logo and icon, if necessary:
