# Advanced Screen Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Advanced Screen [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Advanced Screen package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Advanced Screen package to design your own advanced forms using HTML syntax and JavaScript.

When the Advanced Screen package is installed in your ProcessMaker instance, create a new ProcessMaker Screen using the [Advanced](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#advanced) Screen type. Screen Builder displays a template that contains a sample Advanced-type ProcessMaker Screen.

Use this template to study how to design your custom form. Click the **Preview** button to view your custom form in [Preview](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode) mode.
