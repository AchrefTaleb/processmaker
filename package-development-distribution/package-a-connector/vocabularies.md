# Vocabularies Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Vocabularies package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Vocabularies package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Vocabularies package to maintain uniform JSON schemas across all assets in your organization. These assets include [Processes](../../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md), [ProcessMaker Screens](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md), and [ProcessMaker Scripts](../../designing-processes/scripts/what-is-a-script.md).

Determine which ProcessMaker users and/or groups have permission to view, create, edit or delete Vocabularies by setting [Vocabulary permissions](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#vocabularies).
