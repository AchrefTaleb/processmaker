# Vocabularies Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Vocabularies package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Vocabularies package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

The Vocabularies package requires that Process Owners who design Processes, ProcessMaker Screens, and ProcessMaker Scripts comply with uniform JSON schemas in your organization.
