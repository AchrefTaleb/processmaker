# Actions By Email Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Actions By Email [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Actions By Email package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Actions By Email package to send emails automatically during your Processes' [Requests](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md).

The Actions By Email package has the [Actions By Email](../../designing-processes/process-design/model-processes-using-connectors/available-connectors-from-processmaker/actions-by-email-connector.md) connector that integrates into Process Modeler. Use the Actions By Email connector as you would BPMN elements: drag and place the Actions By Email connector into your Process model, configure its settings, and then add its [incoming and outgoing Sequence Flow elements](../../designing-processes/process-design/model-your-process/the-quick-toolbar.md).
