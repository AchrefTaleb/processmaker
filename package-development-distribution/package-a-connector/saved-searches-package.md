# Saved Searches Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Saved Searches package to save and share searches associated with [Requests](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) and [Tasks](../../using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task.md). In doing so, you maintain the search parameters for your Saved Searches; recipients of the Saved Searches that you share can only view results of those Saved Searches. Share your Request search with specific ProcessMaker [users](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) and/or [groups](../../processmaker-administration/assign-groups-to-users/what-is-a-group.md).

Saved Searches have the following attributes:

* **Configure your Saved Searches:** You configure your own Saved Searches. Those that you share with others can only view search results using the parameters configured in those Saved Searches.
* **Hide Saved Searches:** You may hide your Saved Searches. However, in doing so, they are no longer shared with those ProcessMaker users and/or groups with which you have shared them.
* **Delete Saved Searches:** You may delete your Saved Searches. However, in doing so, they are no longer shared with those ProcessMaker users and/or groups with which you have shared them.
* **Request-related Saved Searches:** Saved Searches associated with Requests display only in the left sidebar of Request-related pages.
* **Task-related Saved Searches:** Saved Searches associated with Tasks display only in the left sidebar of Task-related pages.

The **My Saved Searches** page displays both your saved Request- and Task-related Saved Searches, as well as those that others have shared with you. See [Manage Your Saved Searches](../../using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/manage-your-saved-searches.md).

![&quot;My Saved Searches&quot; page displays your saved searches and those which have been shared with you](../../.gitbook/assets/my-saved-searches-page-package-requests-tasks.png)

Access the search results of Saved Search from the left sidebar of the **Requests**- and **Tasks**- related pages. An icon represents each Saved Search that the ProcessMaker user selects when [creating the Saved Search](../../using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/create-and-share-a-saved-search.md). Saved Searches display above the **My Saved Searches** icon![](../../.gitbook/assets/save-search-icon-package-requests-tasks.png). Click the left sidebar on **Requests** and **Tasks** pages to view search results for each Saved Search.
