# Saved Searches Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Saved Searches package to save and share searches associated with [Requests](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request) and [Tasks](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task). In doing so, you maintain the search parameters for your Saved Searches; recipients of the Saved Searches that you share can only view results of those Saved Searches. Share your Request search with specific ProcessMaker [users](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user) and/or [groups](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/processmaker-administration/assign-groups-to-users/what-is-a-group).‌

Saved Searches have the following attributes:‌

* **Configure your Saved Searches:** You configure your own Saved Searches. Those that you share can only view results of those Saved Searches.
* **Hide Saved Searches:** You may hide your Saved Searches. However, in doing so, they no longer are shared with those ProcessMaker users and/or groups with which you have shared them.
* **Delete Saved Searches:** You may delete your Saved Searches. However, in doing so, they no longer are shared with those ProcessMaker users and/or groups with which you have shared them.
* **Request-related Saved Searches:** Saved Searches associated with Requests display only in the left sidebar of Request-related pages.
* **Task-related Saved Searches:** Saved Searches associated with Tasks display only in the left sidebar of Task-related pages.

‌The **My Saved Searches** page displays both your saved Request- and Task-related Saved Searches, as well as those that others have shared with you. See [View Your Saved Searches](https://app.gitbook.com/@processmaker/s/processmaker/using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches#view-your-saved-searches).

Access Saved Search results from the left sidebar of the **Requests**- and **Tasks**- related pages.

Saved Searches display above the **My Saved Searches** icon![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LJ0aNaVW1m7sNsxVJLV%2F-Ll7HhZbP4VS8bRpk3u9%2F-Ll7ZBgIES7tAC56ITn5%2FSave%20Search%20icon%20package%20-%20Requests%20Tasks.png?alt=media&token=c5638f51-9166-4df8-bef4-af1d8fe515be).
