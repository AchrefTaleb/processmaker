# Saved Searches Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Saved Searches [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Saved Searches package to save and share searches associated with [Requests](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) and [Tasks](../../using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task.md). In doing so, you manage the search parameters for your Saved Searches; recipients of the Saved Searches that you share can only use your Saved Search to view its search results. Share your Saved Search with specific ProcessMaker [users](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) and/or [groups](../../processmaker-administration/assign-groups-to-users/what-is-a-group.md). Furthermore, you may schedule a regular interval in which to email reports.

See [Saved Searches](../../using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/).
