# Saved Searches Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Saved Searches package to save and/or share search queries associated with [Requests](../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) and [Tasks](../../using-processmaker/task-management/what-is-a-task.md).

The Saved Searches package has the following components after it is installed to your ProcessMaker instance:

* **Save and share Request searches:** After enter either a basic or advanced Request search, save the query and optionally share it with specific ProcessMaker [users](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) and/or [groups](../../processmaker-administration/assign-groups-to-users/what-is-a-group.md). See [Search for a Request](../../using-processmaker/requests/search-for-a-request.md#save-and-share-a-request-search).
* **Save and share Task searches:** After enter either a basic or advanced Task search, save the query and optionally share it with specific ProcessMaker users and/or groups. See [Search for a Task](../../using-processmaker/task-management/search-for-a-task.md#save-and-share-a-task-search).
