## Overview

The Collections package allows members of an organization to maintain schema-less data records using [ProcessMaker Screens](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md). The Collections package has the following features:

* An external database is not required to store data records. Records are maintained in the ProcessMaker instance.
* Define the record via ProcessMaker Screens, which makes it easy for any ProcessMaker user to view, create, or edit record data.
