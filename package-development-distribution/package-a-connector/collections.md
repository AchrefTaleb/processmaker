# Collections Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Collections [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

The Collections package allows members of an organization to maintain sets of schema-less data records using [ProcessMaker Screens](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md), each referred to as a Collection. The Collections package has the following features:

* An external database is not required to store Collections. Collections are maintained in the ProcessMaker instance.
* Define the record using ProcessMaker Screens, which makes it easy for any ProcessMaker user to view, create, or edit record data if they have the appropriate permission\(s\) to do so.
* The Collections package integrates with the [Saved Searches](../../using-processmaker/save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/what-is-a-saved-search.md) package. Use the Saved Searches package to save and share searches. See [Saved Searches Package](saved-searches-package.md).

See [What is a Collection?](../../collections/what-is-a-collection.md).
