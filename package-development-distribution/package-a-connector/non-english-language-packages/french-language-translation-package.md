# French-Language Translation Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The French-Language Translation [package](../../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the French-Language Translation package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

The French-Language Translation package displays the ProcessMaker application interface in French language when the French-language option is selected from a ProcessMaker [user](../../../processmaker-administration/add-users/what-is-a-user.md) profile. Changing this profile setting only affects that ProcessMaker user account.

See the following topics:

* [Configure the language setting when editing a ProcessMaker user account as a ProcessMaker Administrator that has permission settings to edit ProcessMaker user accounts](../../../processmaker-administration/add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md#edit-a-processmaker-user-account)
* [Access and configure the language setting for your own ProcessMaker user profile](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md)
