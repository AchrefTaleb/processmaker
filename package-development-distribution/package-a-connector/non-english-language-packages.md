# Translation Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Translation [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Translation package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

The Translation package displays the ProcessMaker interface labels and messages in the default English-language as well as their corresponding French-, German-, and Spanish-language translations. The appropriate set of language labels and messages display for a ProcessMaker user when the **Language** setting is changed in the ProcessMaker [user profile](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md) or ProcessMaker [user account](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/manage-user-accounts/create-a-user-account.md#create-a-processmaker-user-account). Changing this profile setting only affects that ProcessMaker user account.

The default English-language labels and messages may also be changed for English-language ProcessMaker users in your organization.

See the following topics:

* [Configure the language setting when editing a ProcessMaker user account as a ProcessMaker Administrator that has permission settings to edit ProcessMaker user accounts](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md#edit-a-processmaker-user-account)
* [Access and configure the language setting for your own ProcessMaker user profile](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md)
