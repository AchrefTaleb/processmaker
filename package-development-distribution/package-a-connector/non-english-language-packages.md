# Translations Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Translations [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Translations package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

### Display English- and Non-English Language Labels in the ProcessMaker User Interface

The ProcessMaker user interface by default is in English. However, ProcessMaker provides the following translations of the ProcessMaker user interface:

* German
* Spanish
* French

The Translations package displays each label and message in the ProcessMaker user interface in these four languages. For each label or message, the Translations package displays the default English language as well as each non-English language. When the **Language** setting is changed in a ProcessMaker [user profile](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md) or ProcessMaker [user account](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/manage-user-accounts/create-a-user-account.md#create-a-processmaker-user-account), ProcessMaker displays the appropriate labels and messages for that selected language. Changing the **Language** setting only affects that selected ProcessMaker user account.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the Translations package is not installed in your ProcessMaker instance, ProcessMaker only displays the default English-language user interface labels and messages. Furthermore, the **Language** setting in ProcessMaker user profiles and user accounts is not available.
{% endhint %}

### Edit Labels and Messages in Your ProcessMaker User Interface

Optionally, use the Translations package to edit the labels and messages that display in your ProcessMaker instance. This may be useful for the following reasons:

* **Replace ProcessMaker branding with our own:** Your organization uses specific branding and/or terminology that you want displayed throughout your ProcessMaker instance. In this regard, you are replacing ProcessMaker's branding with your own.
* **ProcessMaker is white-labeled:** As a ProcessMaker partner using ProcessMaker for your client, your client may want you to white-label ProcessMaker: hide all ProcessMaker branding and terminology and replace it with theirs.

When replacing ProcessMaker branding and/or white-labeling ProcessMaker, [customize the colors in the ProcessMaker user interface](../../processmaker-administration/customize-the-processmaker-user-interface.md) to show your organization's or client's color palette.

Note that if you edit the default English-language labels and messages in your ProcessMaker instance, you are responsible for ensuring that the non-English translations match your English-language revisions and are accurate.

See the following topics regarding configuring the language setting in a ProcessMaker user profile:

* [Configure the language setting when editing a ProcessMaker user account as a ProcessMaker Administrator that has permission settings to edit ProcessMaker user accounts](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md#edit-a-processmaker-user-account)
* [Access and configure the language setting for your own ProcessMaker user profile](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md)

See the following topics regarding white-labeling ProcessMaker:

* [User interface language management](../../processmaker-administration/user-interface-language-management/)
* [Customize the colors in the ProcessMaker user interface](../../processmaker-administration/customize-the-processmaker-user-interface.md)
