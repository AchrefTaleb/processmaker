# Translation Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Translation [package](../first-topic.md) is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Translation package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

The Translation package displays the ProcessMaker interface in French, German, or Spanish language from a ProcessMaker user profile or ProcessMaker user account. Changing this profile setting only affects that ProcessMaker user account.

See the following topics:

* [Configure the language setting when editing a ProcessMaker user account as a ProcessMaker Administrator that has permission settings to edit ProcessMaker user accounts](../../processmaker-administration/add-users/manage-user-accounts/edit-a-user-account.md#edit-a-processmaker-user-account)
* [Access and configure the language setting for your own ProcessMaker user profile](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md)
