# Email Package

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
The Email package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Vocabularies package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

Use the Email package to integrate email functionality into your Processes. The Email package has the following components after it is installed to your ProcessMaker instance:

* **Process model connector:** An [Email connector](../../designing-processes/process-design/model-processes-using-connectors/available-connectors-from-processmaker/email-connector.md) integrates into Process Modeler. Use the Email connector as you would BPMN elements: drag and place the Email connector into your Process model, configure its settings, and then add its [incoming and outgoing Sequence Flow elements](../../designing-processes/process-design/model-your-process/the-quick-toolbar.md).
* **ProcessMaker Screen type:** ProcessMaker Screens contains the [Email type](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#email) that is used to compose the email body for email messages to be used with the Email package. When creating a new ProcessMaker Screen, select the **Email** type.
