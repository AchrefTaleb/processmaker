# How to Use This Document

## Overview

ProcessMaker is a next-generation business process application to easily design and implement BPMN 2.0 compliant business processes within a modern and extensible system.

Our goal for ProcessMaker is to deliver simplicity, but to allow complexity. ProcessMaker is easy to use, and allows you to design customized processes and end-user experiences.

## Use This Document Based on How You Use ProcessMaker

This document is organized based on how different roles use ProcessMaker. Refer to the following roles:

* [ProcessMaker Administrator](how-to-use-this-document.md#processmaker-administrator)
* [Process Owner](how-to-use-this-document.md#process-owner)
* [ProcessMaker Developer](how-to-use-this-document.md#processmaker-developer)
* [ProcessMaker User](how-to-use-this-document.md#processmaker-user)

### ProcessMaker Administrator

A ProcessMaker Administrator installs ProcessMaker on-premises. \(On-premises installations are not necessary for ProcessMaker Enterprise cloud deployments.\) A ProcessMaker Administrator also performs administrative tasks in ProcessMaker.

Refer to the **Install ProcessMaker** section that includes the following topics:

* [On-Premises Server Requirements](../install-processmaker/prerequisites.md)
* [On-Premises Install Guide](../install-processmaker/installation-guide.md)

Refer to the **ProcessMaker Administration** section that includes the following topics:

* [User Management](../processmaker-administration/add-users/)
* [Group Management](../processmaker-administration/assign-groups-to-users/)

* [Client Authentication Management](../processmaker-administration/auth-client-management/)
* [Queue Management](../processmaker-administration/queue-management/)

### Process Owner

A Process Owner creates and maintains ProcessMaker [Processes](../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md) that both people use to make [Requests](../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md).

Refer to the **Manage and Model Processes** section that includes the following topics:

* [Process Management](../designing-processes/viewing-processes/)
* [Script Management](../designing-processes/scripts/)
* [Screen Management](../designing-processes/design-forms/)
* [Environment Variable Management](../designing-processes/environment-variable-management/)
* [Process Modeling](../designing-processes/process-design/)

### ProcessMaker Developer

A ProcessMaker Developer extends out-of-the-box ProcessMaker functionality in the following ways:

* Develop [ProcessMaker Scripts](../designing-processes/scripts/what-is-a-script.md) that Process Owners use in Processes.
* Develop Connectors that perform custom functions, and then package those Connectors for distribution.

Refer to the [Script Management](../designing-processes/scripts/) section, especially the [Scripts Editor](../designing-processes/scripts/scripts-editor.md) topic.

Refer to the **Connector Development** section.

Refer to the **Package Development and Distribution** section.

### ProcessMaker User

A ProcessMaker user is a person whose only interaction with ProcessMaker is to start, cancel, and/or participate in Requests. 

Refer to the **Using ProcessMaker** section that includes the following topics:

* [Log On to ProcessMaker](../using-processmaker/log-in.md)
* [Profile Settings](../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md)
* [View ProcessMaker Version Information](../using-processmaker/application-version-details.md)
* [Log Out of ProcessMaker](../using-processmaker/log-out.md)
* [Requests](../using-processmaker/requests/)
* [Task Management](../using-processmaker/task-management/)
