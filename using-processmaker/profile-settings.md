Note that English-language is the default language and the only natural language provided for the ProcessMaker open-source edition. However, [packages](../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md) are available that, when installed to your ProcessMaker instance, allow you to change the ProcessMaker labels to [French](../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/non-english-language-packages/french-language-translation-package.md)-, [German](../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/non-english-language-packages/german-language-translation-package.md)-, or [Spanish](../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/non-english-language-packages/spanish-language-translation-package.md)-language. Changing this profile setting only affects this ProcessMaker user account. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how one or more of these non-English language packages can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
