### Don't Know What a Saved Search Is?

See [What is a Saved Search?](what-is-a-saved-search.md) to learn how you can share the same Request and Task search parameters with other ProcessMaker users in your organization.

### ProcessMaker Package Required

To create and share [Saved Searches](what-is-a-saved-search.md), the [Saved Searches package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
