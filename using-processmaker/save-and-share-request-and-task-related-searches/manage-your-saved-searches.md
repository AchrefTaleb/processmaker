## Manage Your Saved Searches

{% hint style="info" %}
To manage Saved Searches, the [Saved Searches](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) package must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

A saved search can only be modified by the ProcessMaker user that created it.
