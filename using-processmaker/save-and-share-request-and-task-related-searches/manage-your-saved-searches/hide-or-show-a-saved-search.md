# Hide or Show a Saved Search

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
### Don't Know What a Saved Search Is?

See [What is a Saved Search?](../what-is-a-saved-search.md) to learn how you can share the same Request and Task search parameters with other ProcessMaker users in your organization.

### ProcessMaker Package Required

To hide or show [Saved Searches](../what-is-a-saved-search.md), the [Saved Searches package](../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

You may hide or show your own Saved Searches. However, you cannot hide or show Saved Searches which have been shared with you. You can only control visibility of Saved Searches that you have [created](../create-and-share-a-saved-search.md).

Hiding a Saved Search only hides that Saved Search from the left sidebar of the Request- and Task-related pages. Sharing recipients of that Saved Search may still use it to view search results using your Saved Search's parameters.

Visible Saved Searches display above the **My Saved Searches** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/save-search-icon-package-requests-tasks.png).

## Hide Your Own Saved Search

You may hide only one of your own Saved Searches. Hiding a Saved Search only hides that Saved Search from the left sidebar of the Request- and Task-related pages. Sharing recipients of that Saved Search may still use it to view search results using your Saved Search's parameters.

Follow these steps to hide one of your own Saved Searches:

1. [View all the Shared Searches that you have created and which have been shared with you](./#manage-your-own-saved-searches). The **My Saved Searches** page displays.
2. Click the **Hide Saved Search** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide-saved-search-icon-package.png) for one of your Saved Searches. The Saved Search is hidden, indicated by diminished visibility of that Saved Search in the **My Saved Searches** page.

## Show Your Hidden Saved Search

Showing a hidden Saved Search displays that Saved Search in the left sidebar of the Request- and Task-related pages.

Follow these steps to show one of your hidden Saved Searches:

1. [View all the Shared Searches that you have created and which have been shared with you](./#manage-your-own-saved-searches). The **My Saved Searches** page displays.
2. Click the **Show Saved Search** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/show-saved-search-icon-package.png) for the hidden Saved Search. The Saved Search is visible, indicated by full visibility of that Saved Search in the **My Saved Searches** page.
