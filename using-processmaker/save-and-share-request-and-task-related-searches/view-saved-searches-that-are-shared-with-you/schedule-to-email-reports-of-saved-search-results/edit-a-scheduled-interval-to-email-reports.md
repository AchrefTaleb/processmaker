## Edit a Scheduled Interval to Email Reports

{% hint style="info" %}
### Don't Know What a Saved Search Is?

See [What is a Saved Search?](../../what-is-a-saved-search.md) to learn how you can share the same Request and Task search parameters with other ProcessMaker users in your organization.

### ProcessMaker Package Required

To edit a scheduled interval to email reports of a [Saved Search](../../what-is-a-saved-search.md)'s results, the [Saved Searches package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}
