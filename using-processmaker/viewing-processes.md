# View Processes

ProcessMaker can display processes you have already created in a list format. Follow these steps to view a list of your processes:

1. Log in to ProcessMaker. For instructions how to do so, see [Log in to ProcessMaker](log-in-to-processmaker.md#header-2). \(Louis note: I can't seem to create a cross-reference to a header within the referenced page--only the page title.\)
2. Do one of the following:
   1. Action 1. \(Louis note: I can't seem to make an ordered list use a different format for a sub-list, nor convert the sub-list to a bullet list without affected the parent list.\)
   2. Action 2.
3. Double-click the process to open it.
