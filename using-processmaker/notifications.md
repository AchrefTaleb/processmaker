## Overview

### Receive Notifications as a Request Participant

Request participants may receive notifications when the following events occur:

* A [Request](requests/what-is-a-request.md) has started for a specific Process.
* A Request participant is assigned a [Task](task-management/what-is-a-task.md). Selecting a notification for an assigned Task opens that [Task's summary](task-management/view-a-task-summary.md#summary-for-an-assigned-task).
* Task assignees and/or Request participants may be notified when a Task is due.
* The Requester's Request is canceled. Selecting a notification for a canceled Request opens that [Request's summary](requests/request-details/summary-for-canceled-requests.md).
* The Requester's Request is completed. Selecting a notification for a completed Request opens that [Request's summary](requests/request-details/summary-for-completed-requests.md).

### Receive Notifications If Results for a Saved Search Change

You may configure your [Saved Search](save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/what-is-a-saved-search.md) to [notify you each time search results change](save-and-share-request-and-task-related-searches/view-saved-searches-that-are-shared-with-you/get-notified-of-save-search-result-changes.md#enable-notification-of-saved-search-result-changes) based on your Saved Search parameters. For example, suppose that you have a Saved Search for all in-progress Requests for a particular Process, such as for a Purchase Request Process. Each time a Request starts for that Process, your Saved Search results change. If your Saved Search is configured to send notifications each time your Saved Search results change, you receive a notification.

Note that the [Saved Search package](../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/saved-searches-package.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance to use Saved Searches. The Saved Searches package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Saved Searches package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
