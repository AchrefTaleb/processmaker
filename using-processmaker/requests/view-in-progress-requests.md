The **In Progress** page displays the following information in tabular format about in-progress Requests:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the Process name associated with the Request. Click the Process name to [view the Request summary](request-details.md#information-for-in-progress-requests).
* **Status:** The **Status** column displays the **In Progress** status for all Requests in this view.
* **Participants:** The **Participants** column displays each Request participant's avatar. Hover your cursor over a user's avatar to view that person's full name.
* **Started:** The **Started** column displays the date and time you made the Request. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker 4 server unless your [user profile's](../profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Completed:** The **Completed** column displays the date and time the Request was completed. Since Requests in this tab are in-progress, this column is empty.
