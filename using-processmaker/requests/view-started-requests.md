* To change the column order of the tabular list, click a header column and then drag to another position.
* To view the next or previous page of requests, click the **Next** or **Previous** pagination buttons, respectively. If the first page of requests is displayed, the **Previous** pagination button is disabled. If the last page is displayed, the **Next** pagination button is disabled. If all records display on one page, both pagination buttons are disabled.
* To adjust how many table rows display in each page, click the drop-down beside the pagination buttons, and then select to display 25, 50 or 100 rows per page. Ten rows per page is the default.
* To adjust the sort order of request information, click the column header in which to sort the records. ~~By default request information is sorted by start date.~~ When the sort arrow points down, sort order is in descending order. When the sort arrow points up, sort order is in ascending order.
