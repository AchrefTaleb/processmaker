# Search for a Request

## Basic Search

You can search for any request of which you started or participated directly from the **Request** page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Search results display only for requests within the **Request** page tab you are viewing. For example, performing a search from within the **Started by Me** tab displays results only for requests within that tab.

To view requests that may not be listed in the displayed tab, use [advanced search](search-for-a-request.md#advanced-search).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to search for a request within the displayed tab:

1. Do one of the following:
   * [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker. The **Started by Me** tab in the **Requests** page displays.
   * Click the **Requests** page if it is not currently displayed.
2. Go to any of the following tabs in the **Requests** page in which to search its requests:
   * **Started by Me** tab \(if it is not currently displayed\)
   * **In Progress** tab
   * **Completed** tab
   * **Watching** tab
3. Click the **Search** field and then enter a search using any of the following criteria:
   * **Request number:** Search for a request number.
   * **Process name:** Search for the process name associated with the request you seek.
   * **Participants:** Search for a participant associated with the request you seek.
   * **Stage:** Search for the stage associated with the request you seek.
   * **Started date:** Search for the date in which the request started.
   * **Completed date:** Search for the date in which the request completed.
4. Press `Enter`. Search results that meet the search criteria within that tab display.
5. Select a row in the search results, and then click the **Request Details** link to [view detailed information](view-request-details.md) about the selected request.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there are no search results, the following message displays: **There are no requests in the search**.
{% endhint %}

## Advanced Search

You can perform an advanced search for any request of which you started or participated. Unlike the basic search, search results are not limited to the currently displayed **Request** page tab: the advanced search feature searches ~~the entire workspace into which you are currently logged in~~.

Search filters you select for an advanced search remain in the **Advanced Search** page for the duration of your current log in session.

Follow these steps to do an advanced search:

1. [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Advanced Search** icon in the left pane. The ~~**Advanced Search**~~ page displays.
3. Click in the **Search** field and then enter your search term.
4. Select any of the following options ~~\(are they check boxes?\)~~ from the **Tab Filter List** in which to filter your search:
   * **Process Category:** Filter your search against the process category assigned to the process associated with a request.
   * **Process Name:** Filter your search against the process name associated with a request.
   * **Status:** Filter your search against the status of a request ~~\(or the process?\)~~.
   * **User:** Filter your search against a username participating in a request.
   * **Request Title:** Filter your search against the title of a request.
   * **Request Number:** Filter your search against a request number.
   * **Process Task:** Filter your search against the process task. ~~\(What is a process task?\)~~
   * **Date From:** Filter your search from a date you specify. The search does not filter prior to the date you specify. ~~Select the date using the calendar beside this option.~~
   * **Date To:** Filter the search to a date you specify. The search does not filter after the date you specify. ~~Select the date using the calendar beside this option.~~
5. Click **Search**. Search results that meet the search filters display.
6. Select a row in the search results, and then click the **Request Details** link to [view detailed information](view-request-details.md) about the selected request.
