# Search for a Request

## Search for a Request

Search for any Request that you started or participated in from any tab in the **Request** page.

{% hint style="info" %}
Search results display only for Requests within the **Request** page tab you are viewing. For example, performing a search from within the **Started by Me** tab displays results only for Requests within that tab.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to search for a Request within the displayed tab:

1. Do one of the following:
   * [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker. The **Started by Me** tab in the **Requests** page displays.
   * Click the **Requests** option from the top menu if it is not currently displayed.
2. Go to any of the following tabs in the **Requests** page in which to search its Requests:
   * [Started by Me](make-a-request.md) tab \(if it is not currently displayed\)
   * [In Progress](view-in-progress-requests.md) tab
   * [Completed](view-completed-requests.md) tab
   * [All Requests](view-all-requests.md) tab
3. Click the **Search** field and then enter text to filter Requests using any of the following criteria:
   * **Process name:** Search for the Process name associated with the Request.
   * **Status:** Search by the Request status.

As you enter text into the **Search** field, Requests display that match your entered text.
