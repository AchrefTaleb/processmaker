# Make a Request

In ProcessMaker 4, a "request" represents when you initiate a process to make a request of one or more people in your organization. Likewise, someone can make a request of you. A request represents an incident or case of a process. For example, you might seek approval for a budget or time off next week.

Follow these steps to make a request:

1. Do one of the following:
   * [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker. The **Started by Me** tab in the **Requests** page displays.
   * Click the **Requests** page if it is not currently displayed. The **Started by Me** tab displays.
2. Click **+ Request**.
