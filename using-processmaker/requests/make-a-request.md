# Start a Request

## Start a Request

Follow these steps to start a Request:

1. [Log on](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click **+Request** from the top options bar. This button is always available.

   The **New Request** screen displays. This screen displays Processes for which you are authorized to start new Requests. Below is the **New Request** screen with Processes from which a Request can be started. Processes can be organized into Categories within your organization to make it easier for people in your organization to locate from which Process to start a Request. For example, Processes for Manufacturing, Human Resources, and Purchasing departments can be organized into their own Categories.

3. Do one of the following:

   * Select the Process to start a new Request.
   * From the **Search** field, enter text to filter the list of Processes, and then select the Process to start a new Request. See [Search for a Request](search-for-a-request.md) for more information.

   The Process you selected starts a Request.

If there are no active Processes or you are not authorized to start a Request for a Process, the following message displays: **You don't have any Processes. Please contact your administrator to get started.**
{% endhint %}

After the Request starts, the Request you started displays in the [**My Requests** page](view-started-requests.md#view-requests-you-started).
