   The **New Request** screen displays. This screen displays processes for which you are authorized to start a new Request.

3. Do one of the following:

   * Select the process for which to start a new Request.
   * From the **Search** field, enter text to filter the list of processes, and then select the process to start a new Request. For more information about searching for a Request, see [Search for a Request](search-for-a-request.md).

   The process you selected starts a Request.
