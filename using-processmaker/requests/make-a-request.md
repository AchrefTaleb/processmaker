# Start a Request

## Start a Request

Follow these steps to start a Request:

1. [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click **+ REQUEST** from the top options bar, as highlighted below.  This button is always available.

   The **New Request** screen displays. This screen displays processes for which you are authorized to start a new Request.

   Below is the **New Request** screen with a process from which a Request can be started. Processes can be organized into categories within your organization to make it easier to locate from which process to start a Request.

3. Do one of the following:

   * Select the process for which to start a new Request.
   * From the **Search** field, enter text to filter the list of processes, and then select the process to start a new Request. For more information about searching for a Request, see [Search for a Request](search-for-a-request.md).

   The process you selected starts a Request.

If there are no active processes or you do not have authorization to start a Request for a process, the following message displays: **No Requests have been defined yet or are available to you**.
{% endhint %}

After the Request starts, the new Request displays in the **Started by Me** tab in the **Requests** page.
