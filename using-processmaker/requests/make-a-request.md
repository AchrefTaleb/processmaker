# Start a Request

## Start a Request

Follow these steps to start a Request:

1. Click **+Request** from the top options bar. This button is always available.

   The **New Request** screen displays. This screen displays Processes for which you are authorized to start new Requests. Below is the **New Request** screen with Processes from which a [Request](what-is-a-request.md) can be started. Processes can be organized into Categories within your organization to make it easier for people in your organization to locate from which Process to start a Request. For example, Processes for Finance, Human Resources, and Purchasing departments can be organized into their own Categories.

2. Do one of the following:

   * Click the Process to start a new Request of that Process. A Request is one occurrence of a Process.
   * From the **Search** field, enter text to filter the list of Processes, and then select the Process to start a new Request. See [Search for a Request](search-for-a-request.md) for more information.

   A Request starts for the Process you selected.

If there are no active Processes or you are not authorized to start a Request for a Process, the following message displays: **You don't have any Processes. Please contact your administrator to get started.**
{% endhint %}

After the Request starts, that Request displays in the [**My Requests** page](view-started-requests.md#view-requests-you-started).
