## Control How Requests Display in a Tab

Use these tips to control how Request information displays in any **Request** page tab:

* If the tabular list is wider than the page, use the two \(2\) arrows on the upper right to vertically scroll the table. Click the right arrow to move the table left. Click the left arrow to move the table right.
* To change the column order of the tabular list, click a header column and then drag to another position.
* To view the next or previous page of Requests, click the **Next** or **Previous** pagination buttons, respectively. If the first page of Requests is displayed, the **Previous** pagination button is disabled. If the last page is displayed, the **Next** pagination button is disabled. If all records display on one page, both pagination buttons are disabled.
* To adjust how many table rows display in each page, click the drop-down beside the pagination buttons, and then select to display 25, 50 or 100 rows per page. Ten rows per page is the default.
* To adjust the sort order of Request information, click the column header in which to sort the records. ~~By default Request information is sorted by start date.~~ When the sort arrow points down, sort order is in descending order. When the sort arrow points up, sort order is in ascending order.
