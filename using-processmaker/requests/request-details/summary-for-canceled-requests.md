# Summary for Canceled Requests

## Overview

Follow these steps to view a summary for a canceled Request:

1. View one of the following **Requests** pages:
   * **My Requests** page. See [View Your Requests That You Started](../view-started-requests.md#view-your-requests).
   * **Completed** page. See [View Completed Requests](../view-completed-requests.md#view-completed-requests-in-which-you-participated).
   * **All Requests** page. See [View All Requests](../view-all-requests.md#view-all-requests-in-your-organization). \(Note that your ProcessMaker user account must have the [**Requests: View All Requests** permission](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#requests) to view the **All Requests** page.\)
2. Do one of the following:
   * From the **\#** column in the Request page, click the Request number associated with the Process that you want to view. That Request's summary displays.
   * Click the **Open Request** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-request-icon-requests.png)for a Request. That Request's summary displays.

## Request History

Below the tabular information summarizing the Request displays that Request's history: all Request actions to that time. The oldest Request actions display at the top of the Request history.

![Request history displays all actions in a Request, with the oldest actions at the top](../../../.gitbook/assets/request-history-requests.png)

The following information displays about each event in the Request history:

* **Request participant:** The Request participant who performed the action is represented by his or her avatar. Hover your cursor over a user's avatar to view that person's full name. If the ProcessMaker system performed an action by running a ProcessMaker Script or other automatic function, that action is represented by "S" avatar.
* **Date and time the action occurred:** To the right of the Request participant displays the date and time the Request action occurred. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker Spark server unless your [user profile's](../../profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Description of the action:** To the right of when the Request action occurred displays a description of that action. The ProcessMaker system generates this action description.
