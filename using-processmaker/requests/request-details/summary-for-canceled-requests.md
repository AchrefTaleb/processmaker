# Summary for Canceled Requests

## Overview

Follow these steps to view a summary for a canceled Request:

1. Ensure that you are [logged on](../../log-in.md#log-on) to ProcessMaker.
2. View one of the following **Requests** pages:
   * **My Requests** page. See [View Your Requests That You Started](../view-started-requests.md#view-your-requests).
   * **Completed** page. See [View Completed Requests](../view-completed-requests.md#view-completed-requests-in-which-you-participated).
   * **All Requests** page. See [View All Requests](../view-all-requests.md#view-all-requests-in-your-organization). \(Note that your ProcessMaker user account must have the [**Requests: View All Requests** permission](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#requests) to view the **All Requests** page.\)
3. Do one of the following:
   * From the **\#** column in the Request page, click the Request number associated with the Process that you want to view. That Request's summary displays.
   * Click the **Open Request** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-request-icon-requests.png)for a Request. That Request's summary displays.

## Values in the Request

The **Summary** tab displays the summary of information entered into the Request to the time of its cancellation. Request information may be entered in the following ways:

* Request participants manually enter information into ProcessMaker Screens. ProcessMaker Screens are digital forms.
* Authenticated users submit data through the ProcessMaker REST API.

The **Summary** tab displays the JSON-formatted key/value pairs in tabular format that represent ProcessMaker Screen control data. Information is displayed:

* **Key:** The **Key** column displays the JSON key name that represents the ProcessMaker Screen control name the Request participant entered data or specified through the ProcessMaker REST API. For example, a Text control to enter your name could be named `Full Name` which would display in the **Key** column here.
* **Value:** The **Value** column displays that key's value as entered by a person manually interacting with a form or specified through the ProcessMaker REST API. For example, a Text control to enter your name could have the value `John Doe` which would display in the **Value** column here.

The **Summary** tab may also display a message about the canceled Request. This message is a ProcessMaker Screen configured to display when Requests for a specific Process are canceled.

Below the **Summary** tab, the history of the Request displays all Request actions. See [Request History](summary-for-canceled-requests.md#request-history).

## Files Associated with the Request

The **Files** tab displays the summary of all files associated with the Request to the time the selected Request was canceled.

The following information displays about each event in the Request history:

* **Request participant:** The Request participant who performed the action is represented by his or her avatar. Hover your cursor over a user's avatar to view that person's full name. If the ProcessMaker system performed an action by running a ProcessMaker Script or other automatic function, that action is represented by "S" avatar.
* **Date and time the action occurred:** To the right of the Request participant displays the date and time the Request action occurred. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Description of the action:** To the right of when the Request action occurred displays a description of that action. The ProcessMaker system generates this action description.
