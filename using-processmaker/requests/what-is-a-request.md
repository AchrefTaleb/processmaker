# What is a Request?

In ProcessMaker 4, a "request" represents when you start a process to make a request of one or more people in your organization. A request represents an incident or case of a process. Below are a few examples of requests that your organization might use:

* You request approval for a budget.
* You request a leave of absence next week.

Likewise, someone can make a request of you. You might be the only person making the decision of someone's request, or you are member of a group involved in the decision process.
