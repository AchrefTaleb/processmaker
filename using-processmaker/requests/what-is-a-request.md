# What is a Request?

## Overview

In ProcessMaker Spark, a "Request" represents an instance of a Process.

Depending on how a Process model is configured, you may [start a Request](make-a-request.md#start-a-request). Below are a few examples of Requests that your organization might use:

* Request approval for a budget.
* Request a leave of absence for next week.
* Request to purchase office supplies.

Likewise, you can participate in others' Requests. This occurs when someone else in your organization starts a Request that involves you. You might be the only person deciding on someone's Request, or you might be a member of a group involved in the decision process.
