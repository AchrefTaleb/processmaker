# What is a Request?

## Overview

In ProcessMaker Spark, a "Request" is a single occurrence of a [Process](../../designing-processes/viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md). A Request is more than just starting a Process. A Request is the workflow routing of one incident of a Process.

This is called a “Request” because many Processes begin with a request for an approval or a decision. Below are a few examples:

* Request approval for a budget.
* Request a leave of absence for next week.
* Request to purchase office supplies.

You may [start a Request](make-a-request.md#start-a-request) for Processes that you have permission to do so. Likewise, you can participate in others' Requests. This occurs when someone else in your organization starts a Request that involves you. You would be [notified](../notifications.md) of the Request and that you have a [Task](../task-management/what-is-a-task.md) to do. You might be the only person deciding on a Request, or you might be among other ProcessMaker users involved in the workflow routing of a Request for a Process.
