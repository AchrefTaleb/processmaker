# What is a Request?

In ProcessMaker 4, a "Request" represents when you start a process to make a request of one or more people in your organization. A Request represents an incident or case of a process.

Below are a few examples of Requests that your organization might use:

* Request approval for a budget.
* Request a leave of absence for next week.
* Request information about a project.

Likewise, you can participate in others' Requests. This occurs when someone else in your organization starts a Request that involves you. You might be the only person making the decision of someone's Request, or you are member of a group involved in the decision process. Furthermore, Requests can be started automatically through the ProcessMaker 4 [REST API](https://develop.bpm4.qa.processmaker.net/api/documentation).
