# Cancel a Request

~~Write an introductory paragraph about what happens when a request is canceled. For example, how are request participants notified? Into which **Request** page tab do canceled  requests go since the request is not completed \(or do they just disappear\)?~~

{% hint style="info" %}
You may only cancel requests in the following circumstances:

* Your user profile must have the ~~name-of-permission~~ permission. Your ProcessMaker Administrator can grant you this permission.
* You may only cancel requests that you started.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to cancel a request:

1. Do one of the following:
   * [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker. The **Started by Me** tab in the **Requests** page displays.
   * Click the **Requests** page if it is not currently displayed. The **Started by Me** tab displays.
2. Mouse hover over the request you want to cancel, and then click the **Cancel** button.
3. Click to confirm the cancellation of this request. ~~\(I assume this happens.\)~~ The request is canceled.
