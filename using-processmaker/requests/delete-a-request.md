# Delete a Request

~~Write an introductory paragraph about what happens when a request is deleted. For example, how are request participants notified? Into which **Request** page tab does deleted requests go since the request is not completed \(or does it just disappear\)?~~

{% hint style="info" %}
You may only delete requests in which you started.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to delete a request:

1. Do one of the following:
   * [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker. The **Started by Me** tab in the **Requests** page displays.
   * Click the **Requests** page if it is not currently displayed. The **Started by Me** tab displays.
2. Mouse hover over the request you want to delete, and then click the **Delete** button.
3. Click to confirm the deletion of this request. ~~\(I assume this happens.\)~~ The request is deleted.
