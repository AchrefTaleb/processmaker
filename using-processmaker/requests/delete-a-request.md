# Cancel a Request

Request participants can cancel a Request in the following circumstances:

* A Process Owner for the Process associated with a Request [selects which permission\(s\) are allowed to cancel a Request for that process](../../designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/edit-the-name-description-category-or-status-of-a-process.md#edit-general-information-about-a-process). If a Request participant's user account has that permission, then that Request participant can cancel a Request for that Process.
* Any ProcessMaker Administrator can cancel a Request associated with any active Process.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your user account or group membership does not have the permission\(s\) to cancel Requests for that Process, functionality does not display to cancel those Requests.
{% endhint %}
