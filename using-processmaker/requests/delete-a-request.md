# Cancel a Request

## Overview

You can cancel a Request in the following circumstances:

* The Process associated with a Request is configured to [allow you to cancel Requests for that process](../../designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/edit-the-name-description-category-or-status-of-a-process.md#edit-general-information-about-a-process).
* Any [ProcessMaker Administrator](../../start-here/how-to-use-this-document.md#processmaker-administrator) can cancel a Request associated with any active Process.

If a Process is not configured to allow you to cancel Requests, then functionality does not display to cancel Requests for that Process.
