## View Your Assigned Tasks

Follow these steps to view your assigned Tasks:

1. [Log in](../log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker. The **My Requests** page displays.
2. Click the **Tasks** option from the top menu. The **To Do Tasks** page displays. Tasks that display on this page are assigned to you.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are viewing your completed Tasks, click the **To Do** icon![](../../.gitbook/assets/to-do-icon-tasks.png) in the left sidebar.
{% endhint %}

![&quot;To Do Tasks&quot; page displays your assigned Tasks](../../.gitbook/assets/to-do-tasks-tasks.png)

The **To Do Tasks** page displays the following information in tabular format about your assigned Tasks:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the name of the assigned Task. Click the Task name to open the selected Task.
* **Request:** The **Request** column displays the Process name associated with the Request for the assigned Task. Click the Process name to [view information about that Request](../requests/request-details.md).
* **Assignee:** The **Assignee** column displays your avatar since all Tasks in this display are assigned to you. Hover your cursor over a user's avatar to view that person's full name.
* **Due:** The **Due** column displays the date and time the Task is due. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker 4 server unless your [user profile's](../profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
