# What is a Task?

## Overview

In ProcessMaker 4, a "Task" represents information that must be acted upon in some way. Tasks are the steps in a Process.

Below are a few examples of Tasks that your organization might use:

* Enter information into a digital form, called ProcessMaker Screens, as part of a Request.
* Approve or reject a Request based on entered information.
* Run an automated script either through a ProcessMaker Script or as an authenticated user in the [REST API](https://develop.bpm4.qa.processmaker.net/api/documentation).
