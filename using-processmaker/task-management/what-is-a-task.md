# What is a Task?

In ProcessMaker 4, a "task" represents information that must be interacted with or acted upon in some way. Tasks are the steps in a business process.

Below are a few examples of tasks that your organization might use:

* Enter information into a form as part of a request.
* Approve or reject a request based on entered information.
* Run a script automatically as an authenticated user in the REST API.
