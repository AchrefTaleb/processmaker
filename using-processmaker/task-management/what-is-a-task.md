# What is a Task?

## Overview

In ProcessMaker Spark, a "Task" represents information that must provided, reviewed, approved, decided about, or otherwise acted upon. People participate in Processes through Tasks.

Below are a few examples of Tasks that your organization might use:

* Enter information into a digital form, called [ProcessMaker Screens](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md), as part of a Request.
* Approve or reject a Request based on entered information.
* Run an automated script either through a [ProcessMaker Script](../../designing-processes/scripts/what-is-a-script.md) or as an authenticated user in the [ProcessMaker Spark REST API](https://develop-demo.bpm4.qa.processmaker.net/api/documentation).
