# What is a Task?

## Overview

In simple terms, a "Task" represents an activity in the Process model. This activity may be information that must be provided, reviewed, approved, decided about, or otherwise acted upon via ProcessMaker software. However, a Task may also be an activity that occurs in the physical environment in which ProcessMaker software is not involved: moving inventory containers or making a phone call, for example. People participate in Processes through Tasks.

For example, each of the following are Tasks that you might use for a purchase process:

* An employee enters information about the purchase request, such as items to be requisitioned.
* A manager approves or rejects the purchase request.
* The purchasing manager enters information on a vendor website to order approved items.
* Warehouse personnel move purchased inventory for shipping.
