# What is a Task?

## Overview

In ProcessMaker Spark, a "Task" represents information that must provided, reviewed, approved, decided about, or otherwise acted upon. People participate in Processes through Tasks.

Each of the examples below are Tasks that you might use for a purchase process:

* An employee enters information about the purchase request, such as items to be requisitioned.
* A manager approves or rejects the purchase request.
* The purchasing manager enters information on a vendor website to order approved items.
