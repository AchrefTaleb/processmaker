# What is a Script Category?

## Overview

Use Script Categories to organize your ProcessMaker [Scripts](../../what-is-a-script.md). Organizing your ProcessMaker Scripts into Categories makes it easier to search for a Script based on its assigned Category. Assign multiple Script Categories to a ProcessMaker Script if necessary. For example, assign a ProcessMaker Script named "Database Call" to the "Database Scripts" and "Data Management" Script Categories.

![&quot;Categories&quot; tab on the &quot;Scripts&quot; page displays all Script Categories in your organization](../../../../.gitbook/assets/scripts-category-page-processes%20%281%29.png)

Script Categories can be in active or inactive status. Following is a description of each status:

* **Active:** Active Script Categories can have ProcessMaker Scripts assigned to them.
* **Inactive:** Inactive Script Categories cannot have ProcessMaker Scripts assigned to them.

ProcessMaker has multiple Category types for different types of assets. Each Category type is distinct from the others and can only be used for its type of ProcessMaker asset. Following is a description of each Category type:

* [Process Categories](../../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/manage-process-categories/what-is-a-process-category.md): Organize your ProcessMaker [Processes](../../../viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md).
* Script Categories: Organize your ProcessMaker [Scripts](../../what-is-a-script.md).
* [Screen Categories](../../../design-forms/manage-forms/manage-screen-categories/): Organize your ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../design-forms/what-is-a-form.md).
* [Data Connector Categories](../../../data-connector-management/manage-data-connectors/manage-data-connector-categories/): Organize your ProcessMaker [Data Connectors](../../../data-connector-management/what-is-a-data-connector.md).
