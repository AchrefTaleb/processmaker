# Stop a Script

{% hint style="info" %}
To stop a ProcessMaker script, you must be a member of the Process Owner group. Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform script management activities.
{% endhint %}

## Stop a Script

{% hint style="warning" %}
Stopping a ProcessMaker script prevents its use from all processes in your organization. ~~However, in-progress Requests can still use stopped ProcessMaker scripts until those Requests complete.~~
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to stop a ProcessMaker script:

1. [View your ProcessMaker scripts](view-all-scripts.md). The **Scripts** page displays.
2. Hover your cursor over the ProcessMaker script to stop and then click the **Stop** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/stop-icon-processes.png). ~~What happens? How do you start the script again?~~
