{% endhint %}

## Stop a ProcessMaker Script

{% hint style="warning" %}
Stopping a ProcessMaker Script prevents its use from all processes in your organization. ~~However, in-progress Requests can still use stopped ProcessMaker scripts until those Requests complete.~~
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to stop a ProcessMaker Script:

1. [View your ProcessMaker Scripts](view-all-scripts.md). The **Scripts** page displays.
2. Hover your cursor over the ProcessMaker Script to stop and then click the **Stop** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/stop-icon-processes.png). ~~What happens? How do you start the ProcessMaker Script again?~~
