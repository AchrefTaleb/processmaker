Use Scripts Editor to develop and test your ProcessMaker Scripts. Any ProcessMaker Script can be used in any process in your organization.

To develop a ProcessMaker Script, you must be a member of the Process Owner group. Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform Script management activities.
