# Process Categories

## Overview

Processes for which a Request can be started can be grouped into Categories. Use Categories to organize your organizational Processes for Requesters.

Categories can be active or inactive. Processes that have been assigned to an inactive Category do not display in any Category for Requesters.

A Process can be assigned to only one Category. See [Edit Process Configuration](view-the-list-of-processes/edit-the-name-description-category-or-status-of-a-process.md#edit-configuration-information-about-a-process) for more information.

## View Process Categories

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the "Categories: View Categories" permission to view the list of Process Categories.

See the Process [Categories](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#categories) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view Process Categories:

1. [Log in](../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Processes** option from the top menu. The **Processes** page displays.
3. Click the **Process Categories** icon![](../../.gitbook/assets/process-categories-icon-processes.png) in the left sidebar. The **Categories** page displays.

![&quot;Process Categories&quot; page displays categories by which to organize Processes for Requesters](../../.gitbook/assets/process-categories-page-processes.png)

The **Categories** page displays the following information in tabular format about Process Categories:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the name of the Process Category.
* **Status:** The **Status** column displays the status of the Process Category. Below is a description of each status:
  * **Active:** An active Process Category can have Processes assigned to it.
  * **Inactive:** An inactive Process Category can no longer be selected when [assigning a Process to a Process Category](view-the-list-of-processes/create-a-process.md#create-a-new-process). Furthermore, Processes assigned to an inactive Category [no longer display to Process requesters](../../using-processmaker/requests/make-a-request.md#start-a-request) even though such Processes may be active.
* **Processes:** The **\# Processes** column displays how many Processes in your organization have been assigned to that Process Category.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the Process Category was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker 4 server unless your [user profile's](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the Process Category was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker 4 server unless your [user profile's](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
