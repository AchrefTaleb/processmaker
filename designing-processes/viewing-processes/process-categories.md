# Process Categories

Use Categories to organize your organizational Processes for Requesters.

Categories can be active or inactive. ~~What value does that provide?~~

A Process can be assigned to only one Category.

## View Process Categories

Follow these steps to view Process Categories:

1. [Log in](../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Processes** option from the top menu. The **Processes** page displays.
3. Click the **Process Categories** icon![](../../.gitbook/assets/process-categories-icon-processes.png) in the left sidebar. The **Process Categories** page displays.

![&quot;Process Categories&quot; page displays categories by which to organize Processes for Requesters](../../.gitbook/assets/process-categories-page-processes.png)

The **Process Categories** page displays the following information about Process Categories:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the name of the Process Category.
* **Status:** The **Status** column displays the status of the Process Category. Below is a description of each status:
  * **Active:** An active Process Category can have Processes assigned to it.
  * **Inactive:** An inactive Process Category can no longer be selected when [assigning a Process to a Process Category](create-a-process.md#create-a-new-process). Furthermore, Processes assigned to an inactive Category [no longer display to Process Requesters](../../using-processmaker/requests/make-a-request.md#start-a-request) even though such Processes may be active.
* **Processes:** The **\# Processes** column displays how many Processes in your organization have been assigned to that Process Category.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the Process Category was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker 4 server unless your [user profile's](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the Process Category was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker 4 server unless your [user profile's](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
