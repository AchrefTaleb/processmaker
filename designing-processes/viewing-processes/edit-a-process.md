# Edit a Process

Prior to editing a process, ensure that the process is not in Active status. Otherwise, it cannot be edited. If the process is active, go to the table of processes and then change the process to Inactive status. For information how to do so, see View a Table of Processes.

Follow these steps to edit a process:

1. Click the **Processes** tab. The table of processes displays.
2. Hover your cursor over the process to edit, and then select the **Edit** icon. The **Create New Process** screen displays.
3. Edit the **Title**, **Description**, and/or **Category** fields, and then click the **WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS BUTTON?** button.
