# Restore a Process

## Restore an Archived Process

Restore an archived Process so Requests can be started against it. After a Process is restored, that Process moves from the **Process Archive** page to the **Processes** page. A restored Process is automatically set to active status.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to archive a Process:

* Processes: List
* Processes: Edit

Ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to restore an archived Process:

1. [View your archived Processes](remove-a-process.md#view-archived-processes). The **Process Archive** page displays.
2. Select the **Restore** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/restore-process-icon-processes-page-processes.png)for your Process. The following message displays: **The process was restored successfully**. The Process moves from the **Process Archive** page to the **Processes** page. See [View Active and Inactive Processes](view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes).
