# View Your Processes

ProcessMaker displays all processes in one table that Process Owners throughout your organization have modeled. This makes it easy to manage processes.

{% hint style="info" %}
To view processes, you must be a member of the Process Owner group. Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform process management activities.
{% endhint %}
