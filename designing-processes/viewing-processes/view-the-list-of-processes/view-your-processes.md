# View All Processes

ProcessMaker displays all processes in one table that Process Owners throughout your organization have created. This makes it easy to manage processes.

{% hint style="info" %}
To view processes, you must be a member of the Process Owner group. Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform process management activities.
{% endhint %}

## View All Processes

Follow these steps to view all processes in your organization:

1. [Log in](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Processes** option from the top menu. The **Processes** page displays all processes created by all Process Owners in your organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
Click the **Processes** ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/processses-icon-processes.png) icon when you are in other process-related pages to view the **Processes** page.
{% endhint %}

![Processes page](../../../.gitbook/assets/processes.png)

The **Processes** page displays the following information about processes:

* **Process:** The **Process** column displays the process name. Click the process name to edit the process in Process Modeler. For more information about Process Modeler, see [Process Modeling](../../process-design/).
* **Category:** The **Category** column displays in which process category the process was assigned when the process was created. For more information about categories, see [Process Categories](../process-categories.md).
* **Status:** The **Status** column displays the status of the process. For a description of possible status types, see [Edit the Name, Description, Category, or Status of a Process](edit-the-name-description-category-or-status-of-a-process.md#edit-general-information-about-a-process).
* **Modified By:** The **Modified By** column displays the full name of who last modified the process. The Process Owner's first name displays before the last name.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the process was last modified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the process was created.

{% hint style="info" %}
For information how to search for a process, see [Search for a Process](../../../using-processmaker/requests/search-for-a-request.md#search-for-a-request).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If no processes exist, the following message displays: **You don't have any processes. Please click on '+PROCESS' to get started.**
