# View All Processes

ProcessMaker displays all Processes in one table that Process Owners have created throughout your organization. This makes it easy to manage Processes.

## View All Processes

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the "Processes: List" permission to view the list of Processes.

Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform Process management activities.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all Processes in your organization:

1. [Log in](../../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Processes** option from the top menu. The **Processes** page displays all Processes created by all Process Owners in your organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
Click the **Processes** ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/processses-icon-processes.png) icon when you are in other Process-related pages to view the **Processes** page.
{% endhint %}

![&quot;Processes&quot; page displays all Processes in your organization](../../../.gitbook/assets/processes.png)

The **Processes** page displays the following information about Processes:

* **Name:** The **Name** column displays the Process name.
* **Category:** The **Category** column displays in which Process category the Process is assigned. See [Process Categories](../process-categories.md) for more information.

* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the Process was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker 4 server unless your [user profile's](../../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
