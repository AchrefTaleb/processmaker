# Activate or Deactivate a Process

{% hint style="info" %}
To activate or deactivate a process, you must be a member of the Process Owner group. Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform process management activities.
{% endhint %}

## Process Status Descriptions

A process can have one of two statuses:

* **Active:** An Active process is one in which Requests can be started using that process.
* **Inactive:** An Inactive process is one in which Requests cannot be started using that process. ~~However, active Requests using that inactive process can be completed.~~

## Activate a Process

Follow these steps to activate a process:

1. [View your processes.](./#view-your-processes) The **Processes** page displays.
2. Hover your cursor over an inactive process and then select the **Activate** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/activate-icon-processes.png). The process becomes active. Requests can now be run using that process.

## Deactivate a Process

{% hint style="warning" %}
When a process is Inactive status, new Requests cannot be started using that process throughout your organization. ~~However, in-progress Requests using that inactive process will continue until they complete.~~
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to deactivate a process:

1. [View your processes.](./#view-your-processes) The **Processes** page displays.
2. Hover your cursor over an active process and then select the **Deactivate** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/deactivate-icon-processes.png). The process becomes inactive. Requests cannot be started using that process.
