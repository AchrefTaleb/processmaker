## Process Status Descriptions

A Process can have one of two statuses:

* **Active:** An active Process is one in which Requests can be started using that Process.
* **Inactive:** An inactive Process is one in which Requests cannot be started using that Process. ~~However, active Requests using that inactive Process can be completed.~~

## Activate a Process

Follow these steps to activate a Process:

1. [View your Processes.](./#view-your-processes) The **Processes** page displays.
2. Hover your cursor over an inactive process and then select the **Activate** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/activate-icon-processes.png). The process becomes active. Requests can now be run using that process.

## Deactivate a Process

When a process is Inactive status, new Requests cannot be started using that process throughout your organization. ~~However, in-progress Requests using that inactive process will continue until they complete.~~
{% endhint %}
