# What is a Process Category?

## Overview

Use Process Categories to organize your Processes. Organizing your Processes into Categories makes it easier to search for an asset based on its assigned Category. ProcessMaker has three Category types for different types of assets. Each Category type is distinct from the others and can only be used for its type of ProcessMaker asset.

Following is a description of each Category type:

* Process Categories: Organize your ProcessMaker Processes.
* Script Categories: Organize your ProcessMaker Scripts.
* Screen Categories: Organize your ProcessMaker Screens.



* * **Active:** An active Process Category can have Processes assigned to it.
  * **Inactive:** An inactive Process Category can no longer be selected when [assigning a Process to a Category](../create-a-process.md#create-a-new-process). Furthermore, Processes assigned to an inactive Category [no longer display to Requesters](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/make-a-request.md#start-a-request) even though such Processes may be active.
