# Archive a Process

## What is an Archived Process?

An archived Process has the following attributes:

* Archived Processes are disabled and inactive until they are [restored](restore-a-process.md#restore-a-process).
* All archived Processes in the organization are accessible from the **Process Archive** page. See [View Archived Processes](remove-a-process.md#view-archived-processes).
* A Process with in-progress Requests can be archived. In-progress Requests will complete.
