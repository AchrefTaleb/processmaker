# Import a Process

Importing a process converts a valid BPMN 2.0 into editable elements in Process Designer.

Follow these steps to import a process:

1. Click the **Processes** tab. The tabular list of processes displays.
2. Click the **Import** icon to the left of the **+ PROCESS** button. The **Open** screen displays.
3. Browse to the file to import, and then click **Open**. ProcessMaker validates the file is BPMN 2.0 compliant and contains no errors. After a process is successfully imported, it displays in the table of processes. If the imported file is not a valid BPMN 2.0 file, an error displays.
