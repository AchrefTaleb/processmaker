# What is a Process?

## Overview

A Process is a set of steps and decisions to document how to complete a particular goal, often as efficiently as possible. Use ProcessMaker Spark to design a model of a Process. The Process model is a graphical representation of a Process that ProcessMaker Spark uses to define the Process. A Process may involve people or be completely automated through scripting. A Process can integrate with external third-party systems and legacy applications to extend their functionality.

It’s easy for business analysts and business managers to model Processes. Business analysts and business managers understand the Processes that they use in their organizations, and they want to define and improve those Processes. For example, business analysts want to learn how much time and money is spent to do work in their organizations, and they want to improve those processes. In ProcessMaker Spark, we refer to these business experts as “Process Owners.”

Any Process designed in or exported from ProcessMaker Spark is [BPMN 2.0 compliant](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/). Furthermore, any process to be imported to ProcessMaker Spark must be BPMN 2.0 compliant.
