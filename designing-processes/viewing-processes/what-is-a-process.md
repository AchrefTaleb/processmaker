# What is a Process?

## Overview

A Process is a set of steps and decisions to document how to complete a particular goal, often as efficiently as possible. Use ProcessMaker Spark to design a model of a Process. The Process model is a graphical representation of a Process. A Process may involve people in your organization or might be completely automated through scripting.

Any Process designed in or exported from ProcessMaker Spark is BPMN 2.0 compliant. Furthermore, any process to be imported to ProcessMaker Spark must be BPMN 2.0 compliant.
