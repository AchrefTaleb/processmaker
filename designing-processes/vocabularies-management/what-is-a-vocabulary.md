# What is a Vocabulary?

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Vocabularies package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/vocabularies.md) is required. The Vocabularies package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Vocabularies package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
{% endhint %}

The Vocabularies package requires that Process Owners who design Processes, ProcessMaker Screens, and ProcessMaker Scripts comply with uniform JSON schemas in your organization.
