### ProcessMaker Package Required

The Data Connector connector requires that the [Data Connector package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/data-connector-package.md) be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Data Connector connector and the Data Connector [package](../../../../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md) are not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition.
