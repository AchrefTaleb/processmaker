# PDF Generator Connector

## Overview

The PDF Generator [connector](../what-is-a-connector.md) is part of the [PDF Generator package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/pdf-generator-package.md) that can automatically generate PDFs of [Display](../../../design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#display)-type [ProcessMaker Screens](../../../design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) during [Requests](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md).

### ProcessMaker Package Required

The PDF Generator connector requires that the [PDF Generator package](../../../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/pdf-generator-package.md) be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The PDF Generator connector and the PDF Generator [package](../../../../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md) are not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](https://www.processmaker.com/contact/) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the PDF Generator connector can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.
