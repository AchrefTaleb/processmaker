# What is Process Modeling?

A process model graphically represents any process, including business processes. One goal of process modeling is to document the process to define, analyze, measure, optimize, and in general improve that process. ProcessMaker 4 follows Business Process Modeling Notation \(BPMN\) 2.0, which is a recognized specification established by the [Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org/) in 2011.

This document describes how to model processes in ProcessMaker 4. However, it does not describe the BPMN 2.0 principles on which process modeling is based. For more information about BPMN 2.0 see the [BPMN specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/).
