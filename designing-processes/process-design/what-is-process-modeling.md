# What is Process Modeling?

A process model graphically represents any process, including business processes. One goal of process modeling is to document the process to define, analyze, measure, optimize, and in general improve that process. ProcessMaker 4 follows Business Process Modeling Notation \(BPMN\) 2.0, which is a recognized specification established by the [Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org/) in 2011.

This document describes how to model processes in ProcessMaker 4. However, it does not describe the BPMN 2.0 principles on which process modeling is based. For more information about BPMN 2.0 see the [BPMN specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/).

The Process Modeler in ProcessMaker 4 is easy to manage. The main characteristics of the new modeler include:

* It provides an easier layout of objects.
* Elements, such as tasks and gateways, are delimited with a yellow line, which delimits each element.
* Elements can be dragged & dropped along the process modeler.
* The Quick toolbar is developed just to connect one element to other elements. It also delete the element selected.
* The BPMN modeler elements now are located at the right sidebar of the process modeler.
* The element context is located at the left sidebar of the process modeler.
