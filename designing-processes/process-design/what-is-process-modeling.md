# What is Process Modeling?

## Overview

A Process is a set of steps and decisions to document how to complete a particular goal, often as efficiently as possible. Use ProcessMaker Spark to design a model of a Process. The Process model is a graphical representation of a Process that ProcessMaker Spark uses as the process definition. A Process may involve people or be completely automated through scripting. A Process can integrate with external third-party systems and legacy applications to extend their functionality.

ProcessMaker Spark follows Business Process Modeling Notation \(BPMN\) 2.0 specification established by the [Object Management Group](https://www.omg.org/) in 2011.

This document describes how to model Processes in ProcessMaker Spark. However, it does not describe the BPMN 2.0 principles on which Process modeling is based. For more information about BPMN 2.0 see the [BPMN specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/).
