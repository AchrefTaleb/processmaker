## Navigate Around Your Process Model

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to navigate around the Process model:

See the [Process](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
