# Add and Configure Event Elements

## Add a Start Event Element

{% hint style="info" %}
For a description of the [Start Event](../process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#start-event) element, see [Process Modeling Element Descriptions](../process-modeling-element-descriptions.md).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add a Start Event element to the process model:

1. [View your processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new process](../../viewing-processes/create-a-process.md) or [select the process name of an existing process to open it](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes). Process Modeler displays.
3. Locate the **Start Event** element ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/start-event-bpmn-side-bar-process-modeler-processes.png) in the **BPMN** left side bar. Drag and drop the element to where in the process model you want to place it. The event has been added to the process model.

## Add an End Event Element

{% hint style="info" %}
For a description of the [End Event](../process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#end-event) element, see [Process Modeling Element Descriptions](../process-modeling-element-descriptions.md).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add an End Event element to the process model:

1. [View your processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new process](../../viewing-processes/create-a-process.md) or [select the process name of an existing process to open it](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes). Process Modeler displays.
3. Locate the **End Event** element ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/end-event-bpmn-side-bar-process-modeler-processes.png) in the **BPMN** left side bar. Drag and drop the element to where in the process model you want to place it. The event has been added to the process model.

## Configure an Event Element

### Edit the Identifier Value

Process Modeler assigns a value to a process model or process element to identify that element. Process Modeler automatically assigns a unique value to each process element added to a process model. However, an element's identifier value can be changed as long as it is unique.

{% hint style="info" %}
All identifier values for all elements in the process model must be unique.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to edit the identifier value for an Event element:

1. Place a [Start Event](add-and-configure-an-event-element.md#add-a-start-event-element) or [End Event](add-and-configure-an-event-element.md#add-an-end-event-element) element into your process model.
2. Select the Event element in which to edit its identifier value. The current Event identifier value displays in the **Identifier** field in the right side bar.
3. In the **Identifier** field, edit the selected Event element's identifier value and then press **Enter**. The identifier value is changed.

### Edit the Element Name

An element name is a human-readable reference for a process element. Process Modeler automatically assigns the name of a process element with its element type. However, an element's name can be changed.

Follow these steps to edit the name for an Event element:

1. Place a [Start Event](add-and-configure-an-event-element.md#add-a-start-event-element) or [End Event](add-and-configure-an-event-element.md#add-an-end-event-element) element into your process model.
2. Select the Event element in which to edit its name. The current name displays in the **Name** field in the right side bar.
3. In the **Name** field, edit the selected Event element's name and then press **Enter**. The element's name is changed.
