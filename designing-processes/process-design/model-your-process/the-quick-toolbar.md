# Connect Process Model Elements

## Connect One Process Model Element to Another

Connecting a process model element to another sets the Sequence Flow between the connected elements. The direction in which the Sequence Flow points implies how [Request](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) data is conveyed and utilized in the process model.

For a description of the [Sequence Flow](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#sequence-flow), see [Process Modeling Element Descriptions](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md).
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to connect one process model element to another:

1. â€‹[View your processes](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new process](../../viewing-processes/create-a-process.md) or [select the process name of an existing process to open it](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes). Process Modeler displays.
3. Select the process model element from which you want to connect to another. Available options display to the right of the selected element.

4. Click the **Sequence Flow** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/sequence-flow-icon-process-modeler-processes.png).
5. Click the connecting process model element. The elements are connected.
