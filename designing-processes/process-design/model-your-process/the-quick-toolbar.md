# Connect and Delete Elements

Process Modeler can easily [connect one element to other element](the-quick-toolbar.md#connect-an-element-to-other) using the **Quick Toolbar** option. You can also [delete an element](the-quick-toolbar.md#delete-an-element) with the Quick Toolbar.

## Connect One Element to Another

Follow these steps to connect one element to another:

1. ​[View your processes](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. Click a process to open it. Process Modeler displays.
3. Select the element from which you want to connect to another element. Available options display in the Quick toolbar. \[Image\]
4. Click the flow connector \(row\) icon.
5. Click the connecting element. The elements are connected.

{% hint style="info" %}
Take into account that the flow connector is not available in an End event in the same flow connector. ~~Louis note: In a previous section, we'll need to briefly describe what a Flow connector is. While we won't write extensively about BPMN 2 components, we'll need to write enough so that a reader who doesn't look at the official BPMN site can use Process Modeler. You can delete this crossed-out text after you read/revise this.~~
