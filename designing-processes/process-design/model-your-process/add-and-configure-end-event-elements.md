# Add and Configure End Event Elements

## Add an End Event Element

{% hint style="info" %}
### Don't Know What an End Event Is?

See [Process Modeling Element Descriptions](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md) for a description of the [End Event](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#end-event) element.

### Permissions Required

Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add an End Event element to the Process model:

* Processes: View Processes
* Processes: Edit Processes

See the [Process](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add an End Event element to the Process model:

1. [View your Processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new Process](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/create-a-process.md) or click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.
3. Locate the **End Event** element in the **Controls** panel.

4. Drag the element to where in the Process model canvas that you want to place it. If a Pool element is in your Process model, the End Event element cannot be placed outside of the Pool element.

After the element is placed into the Process model, you may move it by dragging it to the new location.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Moving an End Event element has the following limitations in regards to the following Process model elements:

* **Pool element:** If the End Event element is inside of a [Pool](process-modeling-element-descriptions.md#pool) element, it cannot be moved outside of the Pool element. If you attempt to do so, Process Modeler places the End Event element inside the Pool element closest to where you attempted to move it.
* **Lane element:** If the End Event element is inside of a Lane element, it can be moved to another Lane element in the same Pool element. However, the End Event element cannot be moved outside of the Pool element.
{% endhint %}

## Configure an End Event Element

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to configure an End Event element:

* Processes: View Processes
* Processes: Edit Processes

See the [Process](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#processes) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

### Edit the Identifier Value

Process Modeler automatically assigns a unique value to each Process element added to a Process model. However, an element's identifier value can be changed if it is unique to all other elements in the Process model, including the Process model's identifier value.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All identifier values for all elements in the Process model must be unique.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to edit the identifier value for an End Event element:

1. Select the End Event element from the Process model in which to edit its identifier value. The **Inspector** panel displays the **Configuration** setting section.
2. Expand the **Configuration** setting section if it is not presently expanded. The **Identifier** field displays. This is a required field.  

   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/end-event-configuration-identifier-name-process-modeler-processes.png)

3. In the **Identifier** field, edit the End Event element's identifier to a unique value from all elements in the Process model and then press **Enter**. The element's identifier value is changed.

### Edit the Element Name

An element name is a human-readable reference for a Process element. Process Modeler automatically assigns the name of a Process element with its element type. However, an element's name can be changed.

Follow these steps to edit the name for an End Event element:

1. Select the End Event element from the Process model in which to edit its name. The **Inspector** panel displays the **Configuration** setting section.
2. Expand the **Configuration** setting section if it is not presently expanded. The **Name** field displays.  

   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/end-event-configuration-identifier-name-process-modeler-processes.png)

3. In the **Name** field, edit the selected element's name and then press **Enter**. The element's name is changed.

### Select the ProcessMaker Screen That Summarizes a Completed Request

After a [Request](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) completes when an End Event element triggers, a [ProcessMaker Screen](../../design-forms/what-is-a-form.md) can display a summary of the completed Request. If a Process model has multiple End Event elements, then each End Event element can reference a different ProcessMaker Screen to display a different summary.

For example, if an End Event element triggers from Lane 1 of a Pool element, then use a different ProcessMaker Screen to display the Request summary than an End Event element that triggers from Lane 2.

When an End Event element is placed into a Process model, it is not configured to display a summary ProcessMaker Screen when it triggers. Therefore, it must be configured.

Follow these steps to select the ProcessMaker Screen that displays when an End Event element triggers:

1. Select the End Event element from the Process model in which to select the ProcessMaker Screen that displays when that End Event element is triggered, thereby completing that Request. The **Inspector** panel displays the **Configuration** setting section.
2. Expand the **Configuration** setting section if it is not presently expanded. The **Summary screen** displays.  

   ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/summary-screen-end-event-process-modeler-processes.png)

3. From the **Summary screen** drop-down menu, select the ProcessMaker Screen that has been designed to display Request summaries if that End Event element triggers. This drop-down menu displays only [Display](../../design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#display) types to display a message to the Request participant. Note that another End Event element located elsewhere in the Process model, such as another Pool or Lane element, may reference a different ProcessMaker Screen to display Request summaries when it triggers.
