# Process Modeling Event Descriptions

The following are brief descriptions about each process modeling event. For more information about BPMN 2.0 see the [BPMN specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/).

## Start Event

A Start Event indicates where a modeled process starts. A Start Event begins the flow of the process. Therefore, a Sequence Flow cannot connect into a Start Event. Below is a Start Event element in a process model.
