# Process Modeler

The Process Modeler in ProcessMaker 4 is more easy to manage. The main characteristics of the new modeler include:

* It provides an easier layout of objects.
* Elements, such as tasks and gateways, are delimited with a yellow line, which delimits each element.
* Elements can be dragged & dropped along the process modeler.
* The Quick toolbar is developed just to connect one element to other elements. It also delete the element selected.
* The BPMN modeler elements now are located at the right sidebar of the process modeler.
* The element context is located at the left sidebar of the process modeler.
