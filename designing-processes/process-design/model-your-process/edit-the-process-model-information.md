# Edit the Process Model Information

## Edit the Process Model Identifier

Process Modeler assigns an identifier to the process model. The default process model identifier value can be changed.

Follow these steps to edit the identifier value for a process model:

1. [View your processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new process](../../viewing-processes/create-a-process.md) or [select the process name of an existing process to open it](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes). Process Modeler displays.
3. Click anywhere in the process model other than any process element so that no elements are selected. The current process model identifier value displays in the **Identifier** field in the right side bar.
4. In the **Identifier** field, edit the the process model's identifier value and then press **Enter**. The identifier value is changed.

## Edit the Process Model Name

Process Modeler assigns a name to the process model that has no association with the process name. This name has no affect on the process model or Requests, so it's name is not relevant. The default process model name can be changed.

1. [View your processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new process](../../viewing-processes/create-a-process.md) or [select the process name of an existing process to open it](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes.md#view-all-processes). Process Modeler displays.
3. Click anywhere in the process model other than any process element so that no elements are selected. The current process model name displays in the **Name** field in the right side bar.
4. In the **Name** field, edit the the process model's name and then press **Enter**. The name is changed.
