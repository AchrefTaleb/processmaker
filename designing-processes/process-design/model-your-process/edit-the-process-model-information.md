Process Modeler assigns a unique identifier to the Process model. The default Process model identifier value can be changed if the identifier value is unique compared to all elements in the Process model.

Follow these steps to edit the identifier value for a Process model:

1. [View your Processes](https://processmaker.gitbook.io/processmaker-4-community/-LPblkrcFWowWJ6HZdhC/~/drafts/-LRhVZm0ddxDcGGdN5ZN/primary/designing-processes/viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/view-your-processes#view-all-processes). The **Processes** page displays.
2. [Create a new Process](../../viewing-processes/view-the-list-of-processes/create-a-process.md) or click the **Open Modeler** icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/open-modeler-edit-icon-processes-page-processes.png)to edit the selected Process model. Process Modeler displays.
3. Select anywhere in the Process model other than any Process element so that no elements are selected. The current Process model identifier value displays in the **Identifier** field in the right side bar.
4. Expand the **Configuration** setting section if it is not presently expanded. The **Identifier** field displays.
5. In the **Identifier** field, edit the Process model's identifier to a unique value from all elements in the Process model and then press **Enter**. The identifier value is changed.
