# File Upload Control Settings

## Control Description

The File Upload control adds an area in the ProcessMaker Screen to which the form user can upload one or more files from a local computer. The form user can drag-and-drop the file\(s\) or select a button from which to locate the file\(s\) for upload. The uploaded file\(s\) can be referenced in a later step in the Request.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is not available for [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}
