# Rich Text Control Settings

## Control Description

The Rich Text control adds a placeholder in the ProcessMaker Screen that displays HTML-formatted text.

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add this control to the ProcessMaker Screen:

1. [Create](../../manage-forms/create-a-new-form.md) or [open](../../manage-forms/view-all-forms.md) the ProcessMaker Screen. The ProcessMaker Screen is in [Editor mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode).
2. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
3. Go to the **Controls** panel on the left side of the ProcessMaker Screen.
4. Drag the **Rich Text** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/rich-text-control-screens-builder-processes.png)from the **Controls** panel anywhere within the ProcessMaker Screen canvas represented by the dotted-lined box. Existing controls on the ProcessMaker Screen canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
5. Place into the ProcessMaker Screen canvas where you want the control to display on the page.

6. Configure the Rich Text control. See [Inspector Settings](text-control-settings.md#inspector-settings).

{% endhint %}

Click the **Delete** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png)for the control to delete it.
