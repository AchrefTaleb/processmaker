# Validation Rules for "Validation" Control Settings

## Overview

Use the following rules to validate your [ProcessMaker Screen controls](./). If a control that has a **Validation** setting does not contain any value or properly structured validation rule, that control automatically passes validation.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want a validation to fail for undefined or `''`, use the [required](validation-rules-for-validation-control-settings.md#required) rule.
{% endhint %}

## Validation Rules

### **accepted**

The field under validation must be `yes`, `on`, `1` or true. This is useful for validating "Terms of Service" acceptance.

### **after:date**

The field under validation must be after the given date.

### **after\_or\_equal:date**

The field under validation must be after or equal to the given field.

### **alpha**

The field under validation must be entirely alphabetic characters.

### **alpha\_dash**

The field under validation may have alphanumeric characters as well as dashes and underscores.

### **alpha\_num**

The field under validation must contain entirely alphanumeric characters.

### **array**

The field under validation must be an array.

### **before:date**

The field under validation must be before the given date.

### **before\_or\_equal:date**

The field under validation must be before or equal to the given date.

### **between:min,max**

The field under validation must have a size between the given `min` and `max`. [Strings](validation-rules-for-validation-control-settings.md#string), [numerics](validation-rules-for-validation-control-settings.md#numeric), and files are evaluated in the same fashion as the size rule.

### **Boolean**

The field under validation must be a Boolean value of the form `true`, `false`, `0`, `1`, `'true'`, `'false'`, `'0'`, `'1'`,

### **confirmed**

The field under validation must have a matching field of `foo_confirmation`. For example, if the field under validation is password, a matching `password_confirmation` field must be present in the input.

### **date**

The field under validation must be a valid date format which is acceptable by Javascript's `Date` object.

The field under validation should be a hexadecimal format. Useful in combination with other rules, like `hex|size:6` for hex color code validation.

### **in:foo,bar,...**

The field under validation must be included in the given list of values. The field can be an array or string.
