# Textarea Control Settings

## Control Description

Though this control displays a vertical scroll bar if more than three lines are inserted, the input box can be expanded as necessary. To do this, click the lower right-hand corner of the input box of the Textarea control, hold, and then drag to enlarge or shrink the control size as necessary. Release when you have adjusted the input box to your required size.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is not available for [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen <a id="add-the-control-to-a-processmaker-screen"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add this control to the ProcessMaker Screen:

1. [Create a new ProcessMaker Screen](../../manage-forms/create-a-new-form.md) or click the **Edit** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-icon.png)to edit the selected Screen. The ProcessMaker Screen is in [Design mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode).
2. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
3. Go to the **Controls** panel on the left side of the ProcessMaker Screen.
4. Drag the **Textarea** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/textarea-control-screens-builder-processes.png)from the **Controls** panel anywhere within the ProcessMaker Screen canvas. Existing controls on the ProcessMaker Screen canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
5. Place into the ProcessMaker Screen canvas where you want the control to display on the page.

6. Configure the Textarea control. See [Design Settings](textarea-control-settings.md#inspector-settings).
7. Validate that the control is configured correctly. See [Validate Your Screen](../validate-your-screen.md#validate-a-processmaker-screen).

Below is a Textarea control in [Preview mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode).

{% endhint %}

Click the **Delete** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/delete-screen-control-screens-builder-processes.png)for the control to delete it.

## Settings <a id="inspector-settings"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to edit a ProcessMaker Screen control:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

The Textarea control has the following panels that contain settings:

* \*\*\*\*[**Variable** panel](textarea-control-settings.md#variable-panel-settings)
* \*\*\*\*[**Design** panel](textarea-control-settings.md#design-panel-settings)

### Variable Panel Settings

Click the control to view its settings in the **Variable** panel that is on the right-side of the Screens Builder canvas. Below are settings for the Textarea control in the **Variable** panel:

* **Key Name:** Enter a unique name that represents this control's value. Use the **Key Name** value in the following ways:

  * Reference this control by its **Key Name** setting's value. The **Data Preview** panel in [Preview mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode) corresponds the Textarea control's textual content with that Textarea control's **Key Name** value. In the example below, `TextareaControl` is the **Key Name** setting's value. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/textarea-preview-screens-builder-processes.png) 
  * Reference this control's value in a different Screens Builder control. To do so, use mustache syntax and reference this control's **Key Name** value in the target control. Example: `{{TextareaControl}}`.
  * Reference this value in [**Visibility Rule** setting expressions](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md).

  This is a required setting.

* **Validation:** Enter the validation rules the form user must comply with to properly enter a valid value into this field. This setting has no default value. See [Validation Rules for "Validation" Control Settings](validation-rules-for-validation-control-settings.md).
* **Control is read only:** Select the **Control is read only** checkbox to indicate that the Textarea control field content cannot be edited.

### Design Panel Settings

Click the control to view its settings in the **Design** panel that is on the right-side of the Screens Builder canvas. Below are settings for the Textarea control in the **Design** panel:

* **Field Label:** Enter the field label text that displays. **New TextArea** is the default value.
* **Rows:** The number of rows to provide for input. **2** is the default value.
* **Placeholder:** Enter the placeholder text that displays in the field when no value has been provided. This setting has no default value.
* **Help Text:** Enter text that provides additional guidance on the field's use. This setting has no default value.
* **Element Background Color:** Select to specify the background color of this control.
* **Text Color:** Select to specify the text color that displays in this control.
* **Visibility Rule:** Enter an expression that indicates the condition\(s\) under which this control displays. See [Expression Syntax Components for "Visibility Rule" Control Settings](expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings.md#expression-syntax-components-for-show-if-control-settings). If this setting does not have an expression, then this control displays by default.
* **CSS Selector Name:** Enter the value to represent this control in custom CSS syntax when in [Custom CSS](../add-custom-css-to-a-screen.md#add-custom-css-to-a-processmaker-screen) mode. As a best practice, use the same **CSS Selector Name** value on different controls of the same type to apply the same custom CSS style to all those controls.
