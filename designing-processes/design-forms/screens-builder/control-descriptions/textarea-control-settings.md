# Textarea Control Settings

## Control Description

Though this control displays a vertical scroll bar if more than three lines are inserted, the input box can be expanded according to the necessity. To do this, simply click on the lower right-hand corner of the input box of the **Textarea** control and without releasing the button of the mouse, enlarge or shrink it until the desired size.
