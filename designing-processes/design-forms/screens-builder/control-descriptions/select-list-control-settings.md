# Select List Control Settings

## Control Description

The Select List control provides either a checkbox- or multi-select drop-down menu-style control from which the [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participant selects one or more options.

Set options that display in this control in one of the following ways:

* **Enter each option:** For each option, enter an internal value, then enter the text that displays in the control. The internal value becomes part of the JSON data model during in-progress Requests for [Processes](../../../viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md) that use this ProcessMaker [Screen](../../what-is-a-form.md). Optionally, organize the order in which the options display in the control.
* **Reference a data source in the JSON data model:** Reference data from the JSON data model during in-progress Requests by specifying the data name, value, and content from the JSON data model as options that display in the control during the Request. Optionally, use a [PMQL](../../../../using-processmaker/search-processmaker-data-using-pmql.md) expression to limit which data to use as options based on the PMQL expression's criteria. The order that data sources render in the JSON data model determines the order these options display in the control; options cannot be manually reordered.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is not available for [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

### Checkbox Functional Description

When using the Select List control with checkboxes, the control functions similarly to multiple [Checkbox](checkbox-control-settings.md#control-description) controls whereby multiple options may be selected. Unlike using multiple Checkbox controls, the Select List control includes all selected options as an array in the order that options are selected. This array becomes part of the JSON data model as shown in the example below in [Preview mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode).

### Drop-Down Menu Functional Description

When using the Select List control as the drop-down menu, the control functions similarly to a [Select](select-control-settings.md#control-description) control, except multiple options may be selected one at a time. Selected options have the following attributes:

* Each selected option displays in the control.
* Each selected option displays in bold-style text in the drop-down menu. Furthermore, a red-colored highlight displays when mouse-hovering over a selected option, rather than the default green-colored highlight.

Follow these guidelines to deselect an item from the Select List control when using the drop-down menu style:

* Click the image![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/remove-group-user-admin.png)for the option to be removed.
* Select the option again from the drop-down menu.

The Select List control includes all selected options as an array in the order that options are selected. ****This array becomes part of the JSON data model as shown in the example below in [Preview mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode).

## Add the Control to a ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to add a control to a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to add this control to the ProcessMaker Screen:

1. [Create a new ProcessMaker Screen](../../manage-forms/create-a-new-form.md) or click the **Edit** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/edit-icon.png)to edit the selected Screen. The ProcessMaker Screen is in [Design mode](../screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode).
2. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
3. Locate the **Select List** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/select-list-control-screens-builder-processes.png)in the panel to the left of the Screens Builder canvas.
4. Drag the **Select List** icon into the Screens Builder canvas. Existing controls on the Screens Builder canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
5. Place into the Screens Builder canvas where you want the control to display on the ProcessMaker Screen. ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/select-list-control-placed-sceens-builder-processes.png) 
6. Configure the Select List control. See [Settings](select-list-control-settings.md#inspector-settings).
7. Validate that the control is configured correctly. See [Validate Your Screen](../validate-your-screen.md#validate-a-processmaker-screen).
