# Select List Control Settings

## Control Description

The Select List control provides either a checkbox- or multi-select drop-down menu-style control from which the [Request](../../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participant selects one or more options.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is not available for [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

### Checkbox Functional Description

When using the Select List control with checkboxes, the control functions similarly to multiple [Checkbox](checkbox-control-settings.md#control-description) controls whereby multiple options may be selected. Unlike using multiple Checkbox controls, the Select List control includes all selected options as an array in the order that options are selected. This array becomes part of the JSON data model as shown in the example below in [Preview](../screens-builder-modes.md#preview-mode) mode.

### Drop-Down Menu Functional Description

When using the Select List control as the drop-down menu, the control functions similarly to a [Select](select-control-settings.md#control-description) control, except multiple options may be selected one at a time. Selected options have the following attributes:

* Each selected option displays in the control.
* Each selected option displays in bold-style text in the drop-down menu. Furthermore, a red-colored highlight displays when mouse-hovering over a selected option, rather than the default green-colored highlight.

Follow these guidelines to deselect an item from the Select List control when using the drop-down menu style:

* Click the image![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/remove-group-user-admin.png)for the option to be removed.
* Select the option again from the drop-down menu.
