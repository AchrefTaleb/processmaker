# View the Inspector Panel

## Overview

The **Inspector** panel in Screens Builder displays settings for a selected control when displaying a ProcessMaker Screen in Editor mode. Editor mode is the default mode when a [ProcessMaker Screen is edited](../manage-forms/edit-a-screen.md). The **Inspector** panel displays to the right of a displayed ProcessMaker Screen. Use the **Inspector** panel to [configure settings for controls](control-descriptions/) you place into a ProcessMaker Screen.
