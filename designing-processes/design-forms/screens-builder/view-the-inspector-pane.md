# View the Inspector Panel

## Overview

The **Inspector** panel in Screens Builder displays settings for a selected control when displaying a ProcessMaker Screen in [Editor mode](screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode). Editor mode is the default mode when a ProcessMaker Screen is edited. The **Inspector** panel displays to the right of a displayed ProcessMaker Screen. Use the **Inspector** panel to [configure control settings](control-descriptions/) you place into a ProcessMaker Screen.
