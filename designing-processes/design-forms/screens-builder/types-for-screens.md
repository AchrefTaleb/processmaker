# Screen Types

## Overview

Use Screens Builder to design different types of ProcessMaker Screens. Savvy developers can design custom ProcessMaker Screen types in [packages](../../../package-development-distribution/first-topic.md). However, ProcessMaker Spark provides the following ProcessMaker Screen types by default.

### Form

The Form type allows Request participants to interact with Request information. Below are a few ways that Request participants might interact with a digital form:

* Enter information, such as name and email address, to apply for a loan.
* Approve the department budget.
* Upload or download documents.

All ProcessMaker Spark Screen [controls](control-descriptions/) in Screens Builder are available for the Form type.

### Display

The Display type, generally used to display information, has limited functionality compared the Form type. The Display type only has the following controls available in Screens Builder:

* [Text](control-descriptions/textarea-control-settings.md)
* [File Download](control-descriptions/file-download-control-settings.md)
* [Multi Column](control-descriptions/multi-column-button-control-settings.md)
* [Record List](control-descriptions/record-list-control-settings.md)
