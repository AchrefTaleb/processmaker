# Screen Types

## Screen Types

Use Screens Builder to design the following types for ProcessMaker Screens.

### Forms

The Form type allows people to interact with a Request in which those ProcessMaker Screens are used. Below are only a few of the ways that people may interact with a digital form:

* Make a request.
* Approve a request.
* Upload or download documents.

All ProcessMaker Screen [controls](control-descriptions/) in Screens Builder are available for the Form type.

### Display

The Display type only displays information. The Display type only has the following controls available in Screens Builder:

* [Text](control-descriptions/textarea-control-settings.md)
* [Multi Column Button](control-descriptions/multi-column-button-control-settings.md)
* [Record List](control-descriptions/record-list-control-settings.md)
