# Add, Remove or Rename a Page

Process Owners can create multi-page [Form-type](types-for-screens.md) ProcessMaker Screens. By default, a ProcessMaker Screen contains one page that has the same name as the ProcessMaker Screen. ~~All Form-type ProcessMaker Screens must have at least one page.~~

Each page has its own name. ~~Screen Editor page names do not need to be unique on the same ProcessMaker Screen.~~

2. Click the **+ Add Page** button. The **Add New Page** screen displays.
