# What is Screen Builder?

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create or edit a ProcessMaker Screen unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Create Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Use Screen Builder to design ProcessMaker Screens for your Processes. ProcessMaker Screens are independent of Processes: any ProcessMaker Screen can be used in any Process, even those that you did not design. ProcessMaker Screens can be [exported](../manage-forms/export-a-screen.md) and then shared with other Process Owners so they may [import](../manage-forms/import-a-screen.md) them for their Processes.

While Screen Builder has an easy-to-use drag-and-place design interface to edit and preview ProcessMaker Screens, ProcessMaker represents them as JSON data models. You can view the JSON data model while in [Preview mode](preview-a-screen.md).

You can use different types of ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](types-for-screens.md).

ProcessMaker Screens are composed of controls. Use controls to provide your ProcessMaker Screen with specific functionality. See [Control Descriptions and Inspector Settings](control-descriptions/).

Below are a few examples of these controls:

* Display text.
* Provide a group of radio buttons to allow the [Request](../../../using-processmaker/requests/what-is-a-request.md) participant to select an option.
* Provide a drop-down menu to allow the Request participant to approve or reject a Request.
* Provide a text area where the Request participant can enter text.
* Provide a date control where the Request participant can select a date.
