# What is Screens Builder?

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create a ProcessMaker Screen:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Create Screens

Ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Screens Builder allows Process Owners to design screens for their Processes. ProcessMaker Screens are independent of Processes: any ProcessMaker Screen can be used in any Process. You can use in your Process a ProcessMaker Screen another person in your organization designed.

You can design different types of ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](types-for-screens.md) to learn more.

ProcessMaker Screens are composed of controls. Use controls to provide your ProcessMaker Screen with specific functionality. Below are a few examples of these controls:

* Display text.
* Provide a group of radio buttons that allows Request participants to select an option.
* Provide a checkbox that allows Request participants to approve or reject a request.
* Provide a text area where Request participants can enter text.
* Provide a date control where Request participants can select a date.

See [Control Descriptions and Inspector Settings](control-descriptions/) for more information about ProcessMaker Screen controls.

## Editor and Preview Modes

Screens Builder provides an Editor and Preview mode.

### Editor Mode

Use Editor mode to build your ProcessMaker Screen. While in Editor mode, use the **Inspector** panel to configure [controls](control-descriptions/) that you place into your ProcessMaker Screen.

### Learn How to Configure Controls

### Learn How to Create a Multi-Page ProcessMaker Screen

{% endhint %}

### Preview Mode

Use Preview mode to view how your ProcessMaker Screen displays.

Furthermore, use Preview mode to view how the ProcessMaker Screen's controls you configured in Editor mode use data in a JSON data model. To allow ProcessMaker Screens to be used among any Process, they are represented in JSON format. You can view the JSON data model in Preview mode as you enter information into your previewed ProcessMaker Screen. Viewing the JSON data model can be helpful to see how values are entered into the ProcessMaker Screen. See [Preview a Screen and Its JSON Data Model](preview-a-screen.md).
