## Overview

Screens Builder allows Process Owners to design screens for their business processes. ProcessMaker Screens are independent of business processes. Any ProcessMaker Screen can be used in any process in your organization. As a Process Owner, you can use in your process a ProcessMaker Screen another Process Owner designed.

Process Owners can design different types of ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](types-for-screens.md) to learn more.

## Editor and Preview Modes

Screens Builder provides an Editor and Preview mode.

Use Editor mode to build your ProcessMaker Screen. While in Editor mode, use the Inspector panel to configure controls that you place into your ProcessMaker Screen.

Use Preview mode to view how your ProcessMaker Screen displays. Furthermore, Preview mode allows you to view how the ProcessMaker Screen's controls you configured in Editor mode contain data in the form of a JSON data model. The JSON data model uses key-value pairs: the key names are those you set when you configured your ProcessMaker Screen controls, while the values are those that you entered while previewing the Screen. During an actual Request in a ProcessMaker process, these values would be those entered by a Request participant.
