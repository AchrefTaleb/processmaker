# What is Screens Builder?

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create or edit a ProcessMaker Screen:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Create Screens
* Screens: Edit Screens

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Screens Builder allows Process Owners to design screens for their Processes. ProcessMaker Screens are independent of Processes: any ProcessMaker Screen can be used in any Process. You can use in your Process a ProcessMaker Screen another person in your organization designed. While Screens Builder has an easy-to-use drag-and-drop design interface to edit and preview ProcessMaker Screens, they are represented as JSON data models. You can view the JSON data model while in [Preview mode](preview-a-screen.md) as well as use it in [ProcessMaker Scripts](../../scripts/scripts-editor.md#enter-json-data-model-variables-from-processmaker-screens).

You can design different types of ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](types-for-screens.md) to learn more.

ProcessMaker Screens are composed of controls. Use controls to provide your ProcessMaker Screen with specific functionality. See [Control Descriptions and Inspector Settings](control-descriptions/).

Below are a few examples of these controls:

* Display text.
* Provide a group of radio buttons that allows Request participants to select an option.
* Provide a checkbox that allows Request participants to approve or reject a request.
* Provide a text area where Request participants can enter text.
* Provide a date control where Request participants can select a date.
