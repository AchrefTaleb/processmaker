# What is Screens Builder?

Screens Builder allows Process Owners to design screens for their business processes. Any ProcessMaker Screen can be used in any process in your organization.

A ProcessMaker Screen can be any of the following:

* A form
* 
{% hint style="info" %}
To develop a ProcessMaker Screen, you must be a member of the Process Owner group. Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform Screen management activities.
{% endhint %}
