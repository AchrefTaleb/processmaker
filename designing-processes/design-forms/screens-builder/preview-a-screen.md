## Preview a ProcessMaker Screen and Its JSON Data Model

Follow these guidelines to preview a ProcessMaker Screen and view its JSON data model:

1. [Open the ProcessMaker Screen.](../manage-forms/edit-a-screen.md)
2. Click the **Preview** option from Screen Builder's top menu.
3. Enter values into the control fields as if you were using the ProcessMaker Screen in a Request. In the **Data Preview** panel to the right of the ProcessMaker Screen, the JSON data model displays the key-value pairs. The key's values are those you enter in the ProcessMaker Screen preview.
