# Screens Builder Modes

## Design Mode

Use Design mode to build your ProcessMaker Screen. While in Design mode, use the **Inspector** panel to configure [controls](control-descriptions/) that you place into your ProcessMaker Screen canvas.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Learn More About the Inspector Panel

See [View the Inspector Panel](view-the-inspector-pane.md).

### Learn How to Configure Controls

See [Control Descriptions and Inspector Settings](control-descriptions/).

### Learn How to Create a Multi-Page ProcessMaker Screen

See [Add a New Page to a Screen](add-a-new-page-to-a-screen.md).
{% endhint %}

## Preview Mode

Use Preview mode to view how your ProcessMaker Screen displays.

Furthermore, use Preview mode to view how the ProcessMaker Screen's controls you configured in Design mode interact with JSON data models. While Screens Builder has an easy-to-use drag-and-place design interface to edit and preview ProcessMaker Screens, ProcessMaker represents them as JSON data models. You can view any JSON data model in Preview mode to experiment with how a [Process's](../../viewing-processes/what-is-a-process.md) JSON data model or another ProcessMaker Screen's data model interacts with your Screen. Viewing the JSON data model can be helpful to see how values are entered into the ProcessMaker Screen as well as to use that JSON data model in your [ProcessMaker Scripts](../../scripts/what-is-a-script.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
 See [Preview a Screen and Its JSON Data Model](preview-a-screen.md).
{% endhint %}

## Computed Properties Mode

Use Computed Properties mode to add Properties to a ProcessMaker Screen's JSON data model. A Property represents any value, mathematical calculation, or formula that computes a value. A Property's computation can be determined either through a mathematical formula or valid JavaScript, and may include values from [ProcessMaker Screen control](control-descriptions/) values during a Request. Likewise, a computed Property's value can be displayed in a ProcessMaker Screen control. Computed Properties can only be used within and only affect the ProcessMaker Screen in which the Property is defined.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Manage Computed Properties](manage-computed-properties.md).
{% endhint %}

## Custom CSS Mode

Use the Custom CSS mode to add custom CSS styles to a ProcessMaker Screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Add Custom CSS to a Screen](add-custom-css-to-a-screen.md).
{% endhint %}
