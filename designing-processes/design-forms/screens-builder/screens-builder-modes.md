# Screens Builder Modes

## Editor Mode

Use Editor mode to build your ProcessMaker Screen. While in Editor mode, use the **Inspector** panel to configure [controls](control-descriptions/) that you place into your ProcessMaker Screen.

{% endhint %}

## Preview Mode

Use Preview mode to view how your ProcessMaker Screen displays.

Furthermore, use Preview mode to view how the ProcessMaker Screen's controls you configured in Editor mode use data in a JSON data model. To allow ProcessMaker Screens to be used among any Process, they are represented in JSON data models. You can [view the JSON data model in Preview mode](preview-a-screen.md) as you enter information into your previewed ProcessMaker Screen. Viewing the JSON data model can be helpful to see how values are entered into the ProcessMaker Screen.

## Computed Properties Mode

Use Computed Properties mode to add JavaScript-formatted mathematical calculations and formulas into a ProcessMaker Screen's JSON data model via properties. A property represents any value or calculation that influences or changes Process routing.
