# Screens Builder Modes

## Editor Mode

Use Editor mode to build your ProcessMaker Screen. While in Editor mode, use the **Inspector** panel to configure [controls](control-descriptions/) that you place into your ProcessMaker Screen.

{% endhint %}

## Preview Mode

Use Preview mode to view how your ProcessMaker Screen displays.

Furthermore, use Preview mode to view how the ProcessMaker Screen's controls you configured in Editor mode use data in a JSON data model. While Screens Builder has an easy-to-use drag-and-drop design interface to edit and preview ProcessMaker Screens, they are represented as JSON data models. You can view the JSON data model in Preview mode as you enter information into your previewed ProcessMaker Screen. Viewing the JSON data model can be helpful to see how values are entered into the ProcessMaker Screen as well as to use that JSON data model in your [ProcessMaker Scripts](../../scripts/scripts-editor.md#enter-json-data-model-variables-from-processmaker-screens).

{% hint style="info" %}
 See [Preview a Screen and Its JSON Data Model](preview-a-screen.md).
{% endhint %}

## Computed Properties Mode

Use Computed Properties mode to add Properties to a ProcessMaker Screen's JSON data model. A Property represents any value, mathematical calculation, or formula that computes a value. A Property's computation can be determined either through a mathematical formula or valid JavaScript, and may include values from [ProcessMaker Screen control](control-descriptions/) values during a Request. Likewise, a computed Property's value can be displayed in a ProcessMaker Screen control. Computed Properties can only be used within and only affect the currently opened ProcessMaker Screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Manage Computed Properties](manage-computed-properties.md).
{% endhint %}

## Custom CSS Mode

Use the Custom CSS mode to add custom CSS styles to control fields within a ProcessMaker Screen by referencing the control's CSS ID in the CSS style sheet language.

{% hint style="info" %}
See [Add Custom CSS to a Screen](add-custom-css-to-a-screen.md).
{% endhint %}
