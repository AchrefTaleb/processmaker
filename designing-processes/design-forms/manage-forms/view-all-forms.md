# View All Forms

ProcessMaker displays all forms in one table that Process Owners throughout your organization have created. Any form developed by any Process Owner can be used in any process in your organization. This makes it easy to manage forms.

{% hint style="info" %}
To view forms, you must be a member of the Process Owner group. Otherwise, the **Processes** option is not available from the top menu that allows you to perform form management activities.
{% endhint %}
