## View All ProcessMaker Screens <a id="view-all-scripts"></a>

ProcessMaker displays all Screens in one location. Any ProcessMaker Screen developed by any Process Owner can be used in any Process. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker Screens.

See the ProcessMaker [Screens](../../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#screens) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
