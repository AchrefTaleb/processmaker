# What is a Screen Category?

## Overview

Use Screen Categories to organize your ProcessMaker Screens. Organizing your ProcessMaker Screens into Categories makes it easier to search for a Screen based on its assigned Category. Assign multiple Screen Categories to a ProcessMaker Screen if necessary. For example, assign a ProcessMaker Screen named "General Applicant Information" to the "Applications" and "Auto Loan Application" Screen Categories.
