# What is a Form?

In ProcessMaker 4, any form can be re-used in any process throughout your organization. Many processes require the same information to be gathered for a Request, such as a Request participant's name, email address, and other business information. Design a form once, and then re-use it throughout any process in your organization. In other words, "design once, use anywhere."

Forms allow ProcessMaker users to interact with process information. Below are a few of ways ProcessMaker users can use forms:

* Enter information into a Request.
* Review information and then approve or reject a Request.
* Upload or download documents as attachments to a Request.
* Display information from script output.

There are many ways Process Owners design forms to meet the needs of their processes. Savvy Process Owners design forms for multiple re-use.
