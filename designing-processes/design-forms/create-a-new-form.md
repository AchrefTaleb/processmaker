## Create a New ProcessMaker Screen

{% hint style="info" %}
Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create a ProcessMaker Screen:

* Screens: View Screens
* Screens: Create Screens

Ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to create a new ProcessMaker Screen:

1. [View your ProcessMaker Screens.](manage-forms/view-all-forms.md) The **Screens** page displays.
2. Click the **+SCREEN** button. The **Create New Screen** page displays.

3. In the **Name** field, enter the name of the ProcessMaker Screen. ~~Character length limitation and/or unsupported characters?~~ This is a required field.
4. From the **Type** drop-down, select the type of ProcessMaker Screen to create. See [Screen Types](screens-builder/types-for-screens.md).
5. Enter in the **Description** field a description for the ProcessMaker Screen. This does not seem to be a required field. ~~Character length limitation and/or unsupported characters?~~
6. Click **Save**. Screens Builder displays the new ProcessMaker Screen in [Editor mode](screens-builder/screens-builder-modes.md#editor-mode). See [Screens Builder](screens-builder/).
