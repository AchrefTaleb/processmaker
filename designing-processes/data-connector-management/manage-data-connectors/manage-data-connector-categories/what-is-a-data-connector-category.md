# What is a Data Connector Category?

## Overview

Use Data Connector Categories to organize your ProcessMaker [Data Connectors](../../what-is-a-data-connector.md). Organizing your ProcessMaker Data Connectors into Categories makes it easier to search for a Data Connector based on its assigned Category. Assign multiple Data Connector Categories to a ProcessMaker Data Connector if necessary. For example, assign a ProcessMaker Data Connector named "Database Call" to the "Database Scripts" and "Data Management" Data Connector Categories.
