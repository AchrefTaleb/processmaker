ProcessMaker displays all Data Connectors in one location. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker Screens.

See the ProcessMaker [Data Connectors](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#data-connectors) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
