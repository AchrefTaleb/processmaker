### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Collections package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the "Collections: View Collections" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Collections unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected. See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.

Furthermore, your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the **View** record-level permission from a Collection's configuration to view that Collection's records. See [Configure a Collection](../manage-collections/configure-a-collection.md#configure-a-processmaker-collection) or ask the manager of that ProcessMaker Collection for assistance.
