## Delete a ProcessMaker Collection

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Collections package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create a ProcessMaker Collection unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Collections: View Collections
* Collections: Delete Collections

These permissions are different than record-level permissions in a ProcessMaker Collection that allow you to view or delete records in that Collection.

See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
When a ProcessMaker Collection is deleted, all records in that Collection are also permanently deleted. However, the ProcessMaker Screens used in that Collection are not affected.

Deleting a ProcessMaker Collection from the **Collections** page cannot be undone.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to delete a ProcessMaker [Collection](../what-is-a-collection.md):

1. [View your ProcessMaker Collections](view-collections.md#view-all-collections). The **Collections** page displays.
2. Click the **Delete** icon![](../../.gitbook/assets/trash-icon-process-modeler-processes.png)for your ProcessMaker Collection. The **Caution** screen displays to confirm the deletion of the ProcessMaker Collection. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/caution-delete-collection-package.png) 
3. Click **Confirm**.
