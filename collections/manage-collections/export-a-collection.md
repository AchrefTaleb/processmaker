# Export a Collection

## Overview

Export a ProcessMaker Collection to your local computer. The exported ProcessMaker Collection may then be imported to the same or another ProcessMaker instance of the same [ProcessMaker version](../../using-processmaker/application-version-details.md#view-processmaker-version-information). An exported ProcessMaker Collection may then be shared with others so they can import your ProcessMaker Collection.

When a ProcessMaker Collection is exported, the following also exports:

* **Records:** All records within that ProcessMaker Collection export.
* **ProcessMaker Screens:** The ProcessMaker Screens used to create, view, and edit records in that ProcessMaker Collection also export.

The exported ProcessMaker Collection has the `.json` file extension.
