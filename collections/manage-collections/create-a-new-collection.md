# Create a New Collection

## Create a New ProcessMaker Collection

ProcessMaker displays all the ProcessMaker [Collections](../what-is-a-collection.md) in one table. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker Collections.

{% hint style="info" %}
### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Collections package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create a ProcessMaker Collection:

* Collections: View Collections
* Collections: Create Collections

These permissions are different than Collection-level permissions that allow you to view or create individual ProcessMaker Collections. Your account or group membership must have these permissions to use the Collections package. See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to create a ProcessMaker Collection:

1. [View your ProcessMaker Collections](view-collections.md#view-all-collections). The **Collections** page displays.
2.
