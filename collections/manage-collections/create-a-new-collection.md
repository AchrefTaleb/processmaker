# Create a New Collection

## Create a New ProcessMaker Collection

A ProcessMaker Collection is composed of at least two [Screens](../../designing-processes/design-forms/what-is-a-form.md):

* **Create a record:** Have available a [Form-type](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#form) ProcessMaker Screen to create a record in the Collection.
* **Edit a record:** Either use the same ProcessMaker Screen that creates a record, or have available a second Form-type Screen to edit any record in the Collection. If you want to use a second ProcessMaker Screen, optionally [make a copy](../../designing-processes/design-forms/manage-forms/duplicate-a-screen.md#duplicate-a-processmaker-screen) of the Screen intended to create a record, and then make changes to it without needing to design a new Screen.
* **View a record:** Have available a [Display-type](../../designing-processes/design-forms/screens-builder/types-for-screens.md#display) ProcessMaker Screen to view any record in the Collection.

Ensure these ProcessMaker Screens are available before creating a new ProcessMaker Collection.

### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Collections package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permissions Required

Your ProcessMaker user account or group membership must have the following permissions to create a ProcessMaker Collection unless your user account has the **Make this user a Super Admin** setting selected:

* Collections: View Collections
* Collections: Create Collections

These permissions are different than Collection-level permissions that allow you to view or create records in a ProcessMaker Collection. See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
