# View Collections

## View All Collections

ProcessMaker displays all ProcessMaker Collections in one table. This makes it easy to manage ProcessMaker Collections.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Don't Know What a Collection Is?

See [What is a Collection?](../what-is-a-collection.md) to learn how to create a set of data records that do not require an external database.

### ProcessMaker Package Required

The [Collections package](../../package-development-distribution/package-a-connector/collections.md) must be installed in your ProcessMaker instance. The Collections package is not available in the ProcessMaker open-source edition. Contact [ProcessMaker Sales](mailto:sales@processmaker.com) or ask your ProcessMaker sales representative how the Collections package can be installed in your ProcessMaker instance.

### Permission Required

Your user account or group membership must have the "Collections: View Collections" permission to view the list of ProcessMaker Collections. This permission is different than Collection-level permissions that allow you to view individual ProcessMaker Collections. Your account or group membership must have this permission to view the Collections package.

See the ProcessMaker [Collections](../../processmaker-administration/permission-descriptions-for-users-and-groups.md#collections) permissions or ask your ProcessMaker Administrator for assistance.
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to view all ProcessMaker Collections in your organization:

1. Ensure that you are [logged on](../../using-processmaker/log-in.md#log-in) to ProcessMaker.
2. Click the **Collections** option from the top menu. The **Collections** page displays the ProcessMaker Collections you are allowed to view. 

![&quot;Vocabularies&quot; page displays all ProcessMaker Vocabularies in your organization](../../.gitbook/assets/vocabularies-page-processes.png)

The **Vocabularies** page displays the following information in tabular format about ProcessMaker Vocabularies:

* **ID:** The **ID** column displays the ProcessMaker Vocabulary's ID. ProcessMaker automatically generates the ID value when the Vocabulary is created and represents a sequential number of how many total Vocabularies have been created to that time.
* **Title:** The **Title** column displays the ProcessMaker Vocabulary's name.
* **Description:** The **Description** column displays the ProcessMaker Vocabulary's description.
* **Modified:** The **Modified** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Vocabulary was last modified. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.
* **Created:** The **Created** column displays the date and time the ProcessMaker Vocabulary was created. The time zone setting to display the time is according to the ProcessMaker instance unless your [user profile's](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md#change-your-profile-settings) **Time zone** setting is specified.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Search for a ProcessMaker Vocabulary

Use the [Search](../../designing-processes/vocabularies-management/manage-your-vocabularies/search-for-a-vocabulary.md) field to filter ProcessMaker Vocabularies that display.

### Create a ProcessMaker Vocabulary

Click the **+Vocabulary** button. See [Create a New Vocabulary](../../designing-processes/vocabularies-management/manage-your-vocabularies/create-a-new-vocabulary.md).

### Edit a ProcessMaker Vocabulary

Click the **Edit** icon![](../../.gitbook/assets/edit-icon.png). See [Edit a Vocabulary](../../designing-processes/vocabularies-management/manage-your-vocabularies/edit-a-vocabulary.md).

### No Processes?

If no ProcessMaker Vocabularies exist, the following message displays: **No Data Available**.

### Display Information the Way You Want It
