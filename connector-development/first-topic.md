# What is a Connector?

Connectors allow ProcessMaker to interact with third-party external applications, systems, and services.

Want to send a Tweet through a business process? There's a Connector for that.

Many Connectors are open-source and compatible with the ProcessMaker 4 Community Edition. ProcessMaker provides many open-source connectors out-of-the-box. The ProcessMaker community can also contribute to the repository of open-source Connectors. ~~Where is the Lua GitHub page for open-source Connectors?~~

Some Connectors are only available for ProcessMaker 4 Enterprise Edition.
