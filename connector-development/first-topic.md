# What is a Connector?

## Overview

Connectors allow ProcessMaker to interact with third-party external applications, systems, and services.

Want to send a Tweet through a business process? There's a Connector for that.

Many Connectors are open-source and compatible with the ProcessMaker Spark.

{% hint style="info" %}
ProcessMaker offers many open-source Lua scripts that function as-is with many third-party services. Use any of them for your own ProcessMaker Scripts or Connectors. [View them here.](https://github.com/ProcessMaker/pmio-lua-connectors)
{% endhint %}

Some Connectors are only available for ProcessMaker Spark Enterprise.
