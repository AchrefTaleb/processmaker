## Hardware Requirements

The ProcessMaker Community edition supports any computer with a modern CPU, an Internet connection, and 2 GB of RAM.

## Software Requirements

{% hint style="warning" %}
The software requirements outlined below are all required for the ProcessMaker Community edition internal beta. The internal beta is a developer-oriented installation procedure that only those who are familiar with the technologies below should perform.

Despite that MySQL database and NGINX web server are required applications for ProcessMaker 4 Community edition, these applications are installed by the internal beta installation procedure. Furthermore, if either MySQL or NGINX are already installed on the computer to which ProcessMaker 4 will be installed, an error occurs. Therefore, do not have these applications pre-installed.
